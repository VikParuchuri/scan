"""Certain materials being removed from libraries such as books, music and magazines, shouldn't be removed from the libraries. It gives people a chance to understand how the real world @CAPS2.     Having certain materials such as books and music definitly should not be removed, because most books and music can show most people how bad the statement in the book @CAPS2 or how bad the lyrics are in a song, and help that person to avoid that type of thing that the book or song @CAPS2 saying to the reader or listener. People should give every type of music at least a try and not always doubt what they hear about what people say about that type of music. I always hear about people saying how bad the band @PERSON1 A.M. @CAPS2, just because in the lyrics it talks about drugs and how much cursing each song has. Really the band @CAPS2 talking about one mans life and how he turns his life from being a drug addict to having the best life someone could ever live. People always doubted him and never gave his music a chance. Another example would be @PERSON1's book, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' for it talks about drug addicts, homeless people, people who have been born with disfigured arms or even someone who lost there legs, and telling how beautiful each and everyone of them really are. His book taught me a few things and made me think different about people. It doesn't matter how they look or how they talk, no matter what, that person @CAPS2 beautiful.     As far as movies and magazines has gone within the last few years, I think that the also shouldn't be taken from libraries. I think @CAPS1 for the same reason of how I feel about the books and music. Of course we see previews of movies and think that they @MONTH1 not be good, but libraries shouldn't keep leave them out. Movies @CAPS2 a great way to learn how to treat others and how to act around other people when you don't know how to act. If you act differently around people that you've never been around before, then you could feel embarassed or maybe even get @CAPS4. Movies can help people learn about the real world by seeing how to do those type of things as we get older. Same goes with the magazines, they also help people see what not to do or to help them understand the consequences of something that shouldn't be done. Knowing what to do from a magazine could possible save your life or perhaps maybe even someone elses life.     I don't understand why some libraries would want to banned certain materials to help people understand the things that happen in someone elses life and to help them not make the same mistakes as that person once did.""","4"

"""Do you think that libraries should remove certain materials off the shelves? People have different oppions, of whats good and whats bad. I have read and seen a lot of books in my life time. I hear people telling me, 'oh dont read that book its a bad book.'But I ask myself, @CAPS2 do I know it's a bad book when I haven't even given it a chance?'      @CAPS1 are some books, music, movies, and magazines out @CAPS1 that are offensive. Yet we still want to read, listen, watch, and look at them. If we tried to remove all the offensive books, from the libraries we wouldn't have anything left on the shelves. Katherine Paterson said, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work i abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson makes a great point out of her quote. Why should we have to remove a book if just some people think its offensive?     Ask yourself the question again, '@CAPS2 do you know it's a bad book when you haven't even given it a chance?' @CAPS3't judge a book by what you hear. Find out what your own oppion is""","2"
"""In @DATE1's world, there are many things found offensive.  Everyone has their own opinion on what is offensive and what is not. Many parents are becoming upset because they think their children are viewing things that they should not.  Other people are upset because they think the libraries are offending their culture or way of life.  This is even taken to the extreme where people want censhorship on libraries to avoid this, which is wrong.     Some people are becoming concerned about the materials in libraries.  They find these things to be offensive.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but there really is nothing anyone can do if someone is offended.  The world is a public place and everywhere we go, something might be found offensive.  The library is a place for study.  It is never intended to offend someone, or bring bad to the world.  It is simply a place to inform, and if someone is offended by what they see, they should stay away from the library.     I have been to the library many times, none of which have I ever seen anything offensive.  Everything I have ever witnessed at the library is for learning and research.  There are certain sections in the library.  If a parent does not want their child seeing something, they should keep their child in the children's section.  I can assure you, there is nothing offensive in the children's section, or else the library would not have it in that section.  The owners of these libraries know what is going to upset people and what will not.  If there was truly offensive materials in the library, those materials would be taken out.     Also, if a person complains, and the materials are removed, it could lessen someone else's chance getting the materials they need.  One person could think the material is offensive, but someone else might want to learn more about it.  If one is offended by a certain material, all they simply must do, is not look at it.  The library can be compared to a big computer.  One can basically find anything there.  Asking the library to censor their materials is like asking the internet to censor theirs.  It is a way of learning and researching and it would be almost impossible to censor everything there.     Everyone is going to be offended some point in their life.  If the libraries removed everything that could offend someone, they would have no materials left.  People need to stop being so easily offended and realize the library is not trying to harm anyone.  There does not need to be any censorship in libraries.  It is simply trying to teach people about the world and let them enjoy books, music, movies, or whatever else one might go to the library to find.""","4"
"""In life you have the 'offensive things'. The little stuff that gets under our skin and eats away at us.  No it is not easy to get over ,but these things will make you stronger. Sometimes there are books, magazines, music and movies  that offened us. The only reason why we get offensive is because the subject either reflects our personality, or our life. It's not the authors fault, they write what they feel and what is the truth.          Okay, so libraris are full of book's, movies, music, etc. You can't just take books off the shelves, just because they offened you. Other people @MONTH1 like the book you hate. There are more books in the library you can read.           Another reason people shouldn't remove offensive material out of the library; it will hurt whoevers' company got the book published and also the writters. Writters and publishers would lose so much money because the library sells' there books,magazines, movies. They make thousands of copies of thier product, which takes money. So to make thier money back ,they sell to thousands of book stores.           Must of the offensive material will open the worlds eye's. Everybody needs to see whats going on in the world. Books, newspapers tell the truth about a subject. Now the writters intent is'nt to hurt you but to help you. Why cant the world be more open?          I know in my own life i have read books that at first ,the book offended me. I would get so mad, i would put the book down and walk away. But then,my eyes would open and finaly it hit me.  The offensive part out of the book helped myself relives a new understanding. The views i used to have would be gone. It is strange how you finnaly open up, and your life changes.     Some people might even find this paper offensive. But if nobody is stepping on your toes, and getting under your skin you wont ever change. Offened is a word used lightly; yes, people use it a lot but do they really mean it. Some people need to use 'well this book bugs me'. Stop being about yourselves and get over it. Life is to short to worry and feel offended.      Every single book, magazine,movie and music needs to be left alone. Those materials @MONTH1 reflect other peoples life and help others with thiers'. Just read another book, or watch a different move. Please do not remove anything from the selves, because it will only do more damage""","4"
"""A lot of @CAPS3 today are censored because of the content in books, music, movies, and Magazines. I think that it all can be fixed if you have certain sections, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and my views on the censorship of @CAPS3. Here's my idea to fix the problem.      I understand that books and other material @MONTH1 offend certain people, but it might not offend others. Thats why I think @CAPS3 should have a room for things that might offend certain people. The sign should say what content it has so the people can stay away from the room. There could be seperate rooms for children. It has nothing but children's books, movies, music, and magazines. Its a great idea because your child would'nt be open to the bad content.      This brings me to my next topic. You must be a certain @CAPS1 to enter the 'bad content' room. I dont think the library staff or their parents want a five-year old boy checking out a book that deals with sex, drugs, and alcohol. The library could get in a lot of trouble. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 could be @NUM1 years of @CAPS1 to enter the room. That seems fair enough. Your old enough to be able to handle the content.      I dont get offended easily, so I can read just about anything. Like I suggested previously in the article, the bad content should be moved to a room so that people dont mistakenly come across it. I like reading about anything and everything, so I would love to read things and spark my attention. Books like that usually deal with bad things. I'm okay with that, but I understand that others are not.      Seperate rooms, @CAPS1 limits, and my views are all good ideas. Maybe a library will come across my article and do what I have said. I think that will be very affective. I hope to start seeing that in the future""","4"
"""How @CAPS4 you feel if your favorite book was taken off the shelves of your school or public library? I, along with many other students, @CAPS4 find this discouraging and distastrous, so I do not believe that censorship should affect books that are on the shelves. Otherwise, a demolished love of reading, crushed individuality, and separated population @MONTH1 be born.     Like the beloved @PERSON2 @PERSON2 series by @PERSON1, many books and series are being taken out of libraries' collections due to people in society finding them offensive. In this case, the world of witchcraft in which this story blooms is against some religious beliefs; therefore, some individuals within a religion campaign to have these books banned. Fortunately, none of the libraries I visit, with their eclectic collections, had banned this series, or I @CAPS4 not have the strong thirst for literature as I do now. All books have the potential to pull a student into the wonderful world of reading, like @PERSON2 did for me, so taking away books that are most likely to spark an interest or start a firework of creativity @CAPS4 not only affect this generation, but the futures of all.          If this censorhip was to be allowed, who is to say what all  could be censored? Who @CAPS4 be the final judge as to what books @CAPS4 be banned? It @CAPS4 all come down to power and who was willing enough to take it. This struggle to be on top has the possibility of seperating people apart like political parties. Disagreements could turn into debates, and those could turn into fights. It can be concluded that people are stubborn for their beliefs, and to have someone choose what everyone is allowed to believe @CAPS4  be wrong. For instance, it @CAPS4 be like an @CAPS1 forcing a @CAPS2 to not believe in @CAPS3; a vegetarian commanding that meat can no longer be eaten; a woman taking away men's voting rights. Censorship @CAPS4 lead to the disrespect of other's opinions, and disrespect is never a beneficial thing.     Each and every person has a different opinion on what is offensive or not, so to censor books @CAPS4 be to censor all individual mentality. Without each person's unique thoughts and beliefs, the world @CAPS4 become similiarly vapid and dull. Differences in beliefs is what adds variety to the population and what makes a person special; additionally, free thought is a right all people should have. If someone was to limit the mental, literary stimulants that are out in the world, the amount of creativity and individuality @CAPS4 decrease.     To conclude, censorship @CAPS4 be a disrespect to individuality, personal beliefs, and the overall joy of reading a good book. Just because one might not believe in what a story says, it does not mean that the piece of literature should be forbidden. No one is being forced to read the books that grace the hundreds of shelves in a library, so if someone is offended, simply do not read it. So how @CAPS4 you feel if your favorite book was gone from all libraries? Disrespected? That is how I @CAPS4 feel""","5"
"""Do you think that you should be able to take certian materials off a shelf of a library, because someone finds it offensive? Here are some of the examples that I can think of just off of the top of my head. Books, movies, music, magazines, or even computer excess. So if you wouldn't mind sit back get relacked in a good comfortable spot, because here we go.      So have you desided what you think about taking them off the self of your local libary or even your school library. We I have came up with what I think about it. In some way yes, but in other ways no. For an example I bet there are old books in my school library right know that haven't even been picked up for a long time, just because they are old and overly out dated.     The reason I say they shouldn't be pulled off the shelf of a library. Well just becasue some people seems that it's offensive, doesn't mean it couldn't almost the most popular book in the hole library. The person that likes that book might find that the poeple that found the book offensive, they book might be offending the other person. So if you think about it, you will  always have the poeple that like to complain about something no where you go.      I just put an example out there of what I have seen. I was at a library one time and there way these to guys. One was complaining how the farm books never get messed with. Then the other guy walked up with two of the books that was over there in the farm section of that library. So the librarian is just taking in all the information that the two guys was disabuting during that time. During all of this I was just about five feet form the counter these guys was at. So then the guy that was talk about how the farm books should get pulled off the shelf he ask the librarian where the books was on spaceships. Then the guy that was getting the farm books said you really should take them off the shelf because he hasn't seen anyone over that way for years.     So that is just to tell you that if you was to take a book, some music, or any other of the thinks that you can find in a library should just more in likely stay where they are, because the library got them books or any of that other stuff for a reason. That reason is, because you don't ever know what someone might just come walking through that door just looking for that lonely book, magizne, movie, or just need to get on the computer.     Well know that you probably getting tired of hearing the reasons why I think no books or any other things should get pulled off the shelf. Now it's time to tells you why they should get pulled off the shelf of that local library in your neiborhood.     The main reason somethings should get pulled off the shelf of the local library or school library is if the book was really damaged. For an example I have been to one of the libraries in my county and they had a book in there that the back cover of the book was torn completly off. That is bad that they would have that on there shelf, just because that makes there library looks like a trashed up place to go to.     Another reason why something should get pulled off the shelf is if the book supported drugs. Like if there was a books about some that was doing drug and they got cought with them and they just got a 'slap on the wrist' as I call it. A slap on the wrist is when you get in trouble for something and you don't even get in any trouble you just get handed over to your parents. That is what I think the saying 'just a slap on the wrist' means.      So all in all more in likely the book should probably just stay on the shelf. Like I said earlier in this essay, you will always have you people that like to complain about every little pitty thing they can find to complain about. Which I mostly learned that from the state tractor pulling club. So I hope that I haven't taken to much of your time up. So just think next time you are at a library and you see a book and you think man that book needed to be taken off the shelfs, just refer back to this essay""","2"
"""The idea of the removal of 'offensive' material from libraries is understandable. Some believe that this material is not appropriate for anyone to view. However, because we all have different opinions on what is offensive, I believe that books found to be offensive should not be removed from the shelves of the library.      First, I believe that if this policy were to be in effect in libraries, there would not be many books left on the shelf. Offensive is a relative word. What @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be to another. Every has a different opinion on different matters based on their beliefs and life experiences. Many books have things people disagree with, but expressing this is a part of freedom of speech. Therefore, if everyone complained that they found a certain book or movie to be offensive, there would hardly be anything left, as Katherine Paterson said.      The purpose of a library is to provide the people who go to the library a resource. If the sources were censored in such a way, it would be hard to get information. Sometimes, it is beneficial, even, to read an opposing view or side to have more knowledge on a certain topic and see things from a different perspective.      However, some books @MONTH1 not be entirely appropriate to certain people. For example, some material in the library @MONTH1 not be best for small children to read or view. In this case, I do not necessarily feel that they should be removed from the shelves rather than placed in an area these children do not have access to.     Having books, music, movies, or magazines removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive is in my opinion, a ridiculous notion. It hinders expression. People have different opinions about what is offensive to them and it would be very boring if everyone thought the same. If someone finds something particularly offensive, I believe they just should not view it""","4"
"""All authors write for a purpose, whether it be to teach, entertain, or persuade an audience.  No author writes something and says, 'I hope no one picks this off of the shelf!' So, if every author wants to express something through their writing, then why should we not let them be heard. We all have the freedom of speech, right? So, why not the freedom of writing? Libraries should not remove a book, music, movie, or magazine from the shelf just because they found it offensive.     Everyone will read a book that they don't like, its natural, but that doesn't mean that no one will like it. Authors write for an audience, but maybe you are not in that audience; so, it doesn't appeal to you and might even seem offensive. Not everyone believes in the same ideas. You could think about an issue one way and your neighbor think about it a totally different way. Like for instance, you're reading a book about a young girl that is going through many problems in her life. She has gotten into some really horrible situations. Some of these situations you read about are so awful that you wouldn't want anyone else to read it. But, did you ever think that maybe there's another girl that is or has gone through some of these same situations. Maybe this girl comes to a library and finds this book; suddenly she finds guidence in it. She finds something she can depend on in her life that she's never had before. She feels like she has a friend in this book that can handle the situations with her. So, would you really want to take that book off of the shelf and not let that girl ever find her guidence?      Situations happen like this all of the time. People find something special in what they read that other people might not find. When a librarian takes a book off of that shelf, an opportunity is forever gone. No one will ever be able to learn of what was to become of that writing and of those ideas. We all have a right to learn, to explore new ideas, and to expand our minds. No one should have the right to take that away""","4"
"""Have you seen a magazine, book, movies, etc., that are found affensive? What experiences did you have? Here is my opinion on if I think that those books should be removed or not.       I have noticed that some movies are affensive to other people. Like for an example, the @CAPS1 movies, books is about @CAPS2 and some people don't believe in them or they don't like the movie so I do kind of see no point of making a movie that is about someone that is not real. However, some movies are okay for some people and their age. The movies that are rated '@CAPS3' are for the people who shouldn't be watching it yet like kids under the age.      Magazines though do have some type of thing that I think that is affensive to other people. Like, I don't remember the name of them but they would have sections that would talk bad about another person like one of the kids would talk about the president or something like that. So I think some magazines should be removed off the shelves.      The books however, I don't see a reason why to have them removed off the shelves. I don't think the books seem to be affensive as much as graphical. There could be some books out there that might be affensive to people though, like the ones that talk about a family that has no money or talk bad about them. For an example, you would be able to find a book and read it and find out that it is talking bout things that you don't want to know yet or want to know.      So as you can see I have made an opinion on what they should do either keep the books, magazines, or movies off the shelf. But then I do see it the other way to. Some of us do like those kind of movies or book or even magazines and think that is very cool or interesting""","3"
"""Personally I don't think libraries, movie stores, etc., should be selling any of the items just mentioned. If they are found offensive to the public. I think it offends lots of people. Citizens such as senior citizens and children shouldn't have to be exposed to inaproppriate material. I think in order to buy or rent certain books, music, movies, or magazines you should have to be at least eight-teen years of age. The economy is bad enough the way it is. There is a new generation of people who are being raised at the moment, and they should't have to look back at their childhood and have memories of seeing offensive movies, or reading offensive books and magazines.      I think music is what influences a person the most. If they are constantly listening to foul language and what not, that is going to just stay into a persons mind. I know this from experience. I also believe that movies influence a peron lot too. For example, a kid goes to see a movie that has a lot of violence in it. Well after he is done watching the movie he thinks to himself, 'well it must be okay to kill someone because i saw someone kill another person because they got away with it and never got into trouble.' That is just one example of how the humans mind can change.     In conclusion I do believe that humans have the right to read, watch, or listen to what they want. I just think that people should have to be a certain age for some of the things though. Also, I think that anything citizens find offending should be hidden in some sort of area in a store or library. So that  just people who want a certain item or whatever can get it with out other people having to see or listen to anything offending""","3"
"""A library is a place you can go to read, write, and relax.  Nowadays, many people take for granted the knowledge that can be obtained there.  Even more of the knowledge to be learned is being stripped away and cut down by censorship.  Censorship can eliminate many varieties of reading materials that people can learn from and enjoy.       First of all, removing classics from the shelves of libraries because they @MONTH1 offend certain people is completely unwarranted.  If they offend you then do not read them.  It is as simple as that.  Many books offend people because they are not in agreement with their morals or beliefs.  A great example of this is the @PERSON2 series.  @PERSON2 @PERSON2 is a bestselling series with over a million copies that have been sold worldwide; however, it does not corrolate with many people's beliefs.  Therefore those people boycott the series.     I remember several years ago I attended a @PERSON2 @PERSON2 and the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 party at the local library to celebrate the next book in the series being released.  While I was at the library there was a gigantic storm brewing.  Now most people would think that it was only a storm, but the people in town who did not like the @PERSON2 books blamed it on the party.  They said that we were worshipping the devil and @CAPS4 brought the storm to tell us that what we were doing was wrong.  I know many people do not like the @PERSON2 series because there is witchcraft and wizardry in it, but that does not mean that they should blame natural occurences on a book!       Even great novels like the @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 should not be banned because of their content.  For a while, @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 was reading material for school, but then the 'morality police' banned it because it was about a crazy person.  Books should not be required to meet everyone's personal standards.     Consequently, what Katherine Paterson states is true.  If we ban books because we do not agree with them or find them suitable, eventually there will not be any left to check out at the library.  Although there could be a way to compromise.  If the books with questionable content had a sticker on them telling the reader that, then it could benefit both sides.       In conclusion, eliminating books is not a good idea because of how beneficial they are to us all, especially children.  When I was young I would always want to be read to and when I continued to age I would always read.  While I was in middle school every day I would have a book with me to read.  Books allow the reader to travel to far off places or see what it would be like to walk in someone else's shoes.  Books are a gateway to another world.  Why take that magic away from children""","5"
"""Yes and no, some materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc, should be voted upon the citizens to be removed from shelves.          I do think that some materials in those catagories should be removed if they are offensive to me as well as others, but it will take a long while to get them removed from stores and other places if other people like them. I do not like how they make some music to be very violent and cause minds of most teenagers to turn bad and start selling drugs on the street of their hometown, but i can't do anything about that because that kind of music is admired by those teenagers as well as some adults too. If some people can buckle down and see that stuff like that will mess up lives of teenagers and some adults who fall victim to it, then there is a chance that it can be stopped. Stopping things like this will save a community from disaster and cause other good chances in life for people in need for those chances.     Here's another example, like this music artist named @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She has made some great songs for the past year and a half now. People have told me that she is part of a group called @CAPS3 and its a group where they try to I think 're-birth' thereselves. My friends wanted me to stop listening to her music. I told my friends that I do not like the fact that she joined this group, but that doesnt mean im gonna stop listen to her music. Now if she makes a song that is offensive to me and as well as my friends, then that where I draw the line.     What im saying is that if people don't have others to back them up if something is highly offensive to them and oblivious to others, it will be very hard trying to prove yourself in the best way possible.""","3"
"""When talking about censorship in libraries, I don't think the people that work in the libraries should decide what goes on the shelves. The people of the community should have a say on what goes on the shelves, because their the ones thats going to the library anyway.                 I believe that everybody is intitle to their own opinion, but I think certain materials should be removed.  For example, some music could be offensive; therefore, I'm not saying that music shouldn't be totally removed from libraries. I'm saying the offensive music should be removed""","3"

I believe that certain materials such as books, music,movies,ect. that are found offensive should not be allowed to be removed from a libraries book shelves, let alone even be on the shelves.     Now lets just think about this for a moment.What if a sexist book fell into the hands of an inocent childs hands that could just read enough to get through the book? That child could end up living that kind of life that the book protays. If I were a parentt I know for a fact I would never want my children exposed to harmful reading materials until they know right from wrong, and have a clear judgement on it.     Or from another perspective what if that  one book, about @CAPS1 black people are bad and nasty, fell into the wrong hands for this purpose lets say a drunken, old fashioned man. Who just so happens to think we should continue slavery. That one book could stimulate this white mans thoughts and he could try to put his thoughts into action. Throwing what that book says about black people in a young black womans face. Then continues ,after seeing what that alone has done to her, rapes and beats her.

"""A lot of people that are in school have probably seen or heard of a book or magazine that had profanity or offended them. Some people think that kind of thing is funny, but to others it @MONTH1 bother them. Not only racial slurs can offend people, but profanity can make someone disappointed. Some parents do not want their child to hearing or saying things like that. And I believe if it is offensive it should be taken off the shelf in a library and you should too.     The movies and music I think if it really offended somebody that they should have to either change the lyrics or get rid of it. They just should not offend somebody to be a good song or a really great movie. You can't not make something that is making fun of another race or a movie of killing them.          Going to like school libraries, for books I think it really depends on the age group. Like their should not be anything that would be offensive or profanity in the @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @CAPS4. They are just not old enough or mature to be seeing or reading those things in books or magazines. So if a student comes home with a book the class is reading and the parent doesn't like the content they should have the right to say that they don't want their child reading it. And if was really bad be able to take it out of the school.     Even @CAPS3 @CAPS4 that have more mature students get offended sometimes from the books their reading in school. One in example is 'To @CAPS5 a @CAPS6'. Even though it is a really good book and a lot of @CAPS4 read it. A lot of @CAPS7 @CAPS8 might get offended by all the racial slurs about @CAPS7 @CAPS8. They just do not feel comfortable fellow students saying them and their teachers saying them. And the @CAPS4 or libraries just should not make students read books that they don't feel comfortable reading. Or the libraries having books like that.     Me in example, next year I'm going to have to read that book and I am just not going to like it. I'm half @CAPS7 @CAPS12 and I do not like people saying things like that. It is going to be a really akward moment for me. And I have some other friends that have read that book that didn't feel comfortable reading that book.     Their are even little kid books that parents want out of their childs school library. The most challenged book in school libraries is @CAPS13 @CAPS14. I know this because my librarian told me this one day. It is just a good book, but some parents don't want their kids reading about witchcraft and wizards. So they try to get them out of the library. And they should if the parents do't want their kids reading it.     I just think if their is a certain amount of people complaining about a movie or song that their should not even be a fight about it. They should just get rid of it. Same thing in a school, if their is students or parents that are complaining and their is a certain amount of them, the librarian should not even have a say in it or the school. They should just get rid of the book or magazine.     I believe that if it a book, song, movie , etc is offensive to a certain amount of people that it should just be taken care of by getting rid of it. Parents might not want their kids seeing, hearing, or reading that sort of stuff. And some people get offended by some books or movies. Or they just do't feel comfortable. I believe that things that are brought to the world for entertainment should also be able to get out of the world if people are offended by it.""","4"
"""Do you think that if certain books, music, movies, and magazines shout be removed from shelves because someone finds them offensive? Such as magazines, books, movies, and even music. I simply do not find any of it right that few peoples opinion's should matter depending on what they find offensive for two reasons. Those reasons being that you picked it out yourself and that you have traveled to the library looking for something you will enjoy.     The first reason I think that certain books, music, movies and magazines should not be removed form the shelves are because people have picked them out there selves. Noone is ever going to pick up a book or magazine or even watch movies and listen to music that looks, seems, or even sounds offensive. Mainly because alot of people don't take being ofeneded to kindly. For example, why would a person buy an object that does not seem appealing to them?     The second reason that I think that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves are because if your going to the library your looking for an interesting book, type of music, a movie, or a magazine. Most likely you're going to end up getting one that looks intersting to you and something that you feel fits your taste. So if there is a book, some sort of music, a movie, or a magazine and it looks offensive then don't get it because if somethings going to offend you its going to be pretty obvious due to what it looks like, seems like, or even sounds like.     In my opinion I think that if certain books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive to some people that they should not be taken off the shelf. If you picked something out at the library or went to the library looking for something that you would enjoy, you will obviously end up knowing if something looks, seems, or even sounds offensive""","3"

If a kid picks up the book and reads it, and there are bad content in the books, magazines, music and movies that would be bad to read. If they are young enough and they don't know if the movies or anything else in the library are bad, then it's the library's fault for letting them get the book movies, music or magazines. If the parent doesn't know that their kid read the book their parents will be wondering where they got bad phrases from. There are people that think that any libraries should have any bad books.     There are many things in books that parents don't want their children to read. There are things like books that talk about sex. There can also be language that the kids should not read. I know for sure, that I don't want my kids to read anything bad when they grow older.         There are also music that parents don't want kids to listen to. There is things like sex songs. There are also things that don't say sex directly, but imply it. I never want my kids to listen to bad songs like that, I want them to be responsible and not listen to terrible songs.     There is also movies that I don't want my kids to watch, because of the content of the movie. There are so many things in this world that contain bad things, which all have something to do with sex. Latly all the movies that came out are very inapropriate.      Their is one more thing that I think is very important, which is magazines. There are many things that can happen in magazines like porn. I hate when kids are tempted or forced to look at porn.

"""Dear news people,     I am qriting to you because I have my own answer on what people should do with books. I think it is ok for people to write whatever thay want because it's a free contruy to where you can do anything that you tink you can do. What I am trying to say is that people can write books how ever thay want with anything in it such as drugs, sex, abuse, bad language, and so on you get what I'm saying. I think it's ok to write whatever they want and put whatever it was they wrote about on the shelf. It's they person who is picking a book choose to read a book just because they don't like what the book was about they don't have to make a big deal about it and cause a problem. People can just not pick the book up and look for another book.     I don't think it's fear that people should make a big deal out of a book that they don't have to read at all it makes no since to me and I bet a lot of people would agree. If I was someone who was a aganised stuff like sex, and drugs and I saw it in a book I would just set it down and look for a book that I would agree with than causing a problem like others would. It just is not fare and it's a waist of time to me if someone has to complane about something so dumb.     So to rap this thing up I think people who don't like the way books are writen should just put it down and not worry about it and buy a book that they feel better off with reading. There is no point to waist time and cause a problem that's my oppion about this problem hope it is yours to.""","3"

"""Books Removed From Shelves?      'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the chelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that I work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no nooks left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 statement was from @PERSON1.  Do you think it is right for young children to look at immages that are not appropiate or read something that is talking baout sexual content?  I do not think any of these materials should be removed from the shelves, but they should be put in a privite area where only adults can get to them.       I think they should be put in a certain area, away from children, because children will get ideas from the material that they see and think it is okay to act like that.  There are some books and movies out there that teenagers and young children see that are about cereal killers and children think it is okay to bring guns to school and it is not okay.  Children are reading these books and thinking it is okay to act like their favorite character or acting like their favorite movie star in a movie.  Some of the movies that are out there are about doing stupid stuff, and children and teenagers think it is 'cool' because the person that they look up to is doing that, so they want to try it out also.  Children get hurt from doing @CAPS1.  Whenever a child sees people having sex, they think it is okay to do it too, becasue those kids in the movies are the same age as they are.   I think that movie producers shoudl be aware of what they put out there for children to watch.       When you talk about the book @CAPS2 @CAPS3, you think what a great book.  But would you ever think that it would be taken off of shelves because of one word that was used in it?  I think that it should stay on the shelves, but if a parent does not want their child to read it, then they do not have to read it.  If parents do not want their child to read something then just tell the teacher or child that they cannot read the book.  I think the books should stay on the shelves and any material that has any 'bad' sontent on it should be put in a private section where only adults can get to it.       Do you want your children looking at bad pictures or seeing or reading about something with sexual content?  Children are getting bad ideas from books, movies, magazines, and music.  They think it is appropiate to act like @CAPS1, because their favotire movie star is preforming @CAPS1 way.  These books, movies, and magazines need to be put up out of children's reach, so they cannot get anymore bad ideas to do stupid stuff""","4"
"""I think almost every movie might offend someone in some way, So if your wanting to take every movie off the shelf then go ahead. Everyone has different taste in movies, music, books, etc. If the music offends you, don't listen to @CAPS2. If a book does, don't read @CAPS2. Its as simple as that. So I don't think they should remove the books, music, movies, etc. That could offend someone, and here are my reason why;          If you were to remove all the things that might interest the people now a-day, then you wouldn't have anything that entertains the kids instead of them going out and getting in trouble, I believe every person has the right to read, watch, or listen to whatever @CAPS2 is they want to listen to. Also If they find @CAPS2 offensive then they just shouldn't listen that song, watch that movie, or even read the book or magazines. Everyones offended in different ways from another, So we can't help @CAPS2 if @CAPS3 little book, song, etc., offends a person.          I also think if you give a kid the chance to read @CAPS2, and he sees how offensive @CAPS2 might be, @CAPS2 might keep him/her from doing some of the things he might do if he didn't read the book, Also if he watches what movies he wants, he will learn that, @CAPS1 every body is good people. Children read in a wide variety, some read there dr.suess books and other could be reading @PERSON1 '@CAPS2'. Depending on the children they should be able to choose what they read, listen to or watch. The only flaw I find about Children down side to some magazines is the fact almost every magazine has atleast @CAPS3 half naked women, or man in @CAPS2. Children in there @ORGANIZATION1 years through about first year of @ORGANIZATION2 should @CAPS1 have to see that.          My @CAPS4 reason is, people have many different tastes in the materials, so I believe they can read what they want as long as @CAPS2 does @CAPS1 offend them. What there reading should @CAPS1 have any effect on others unless they are reading @CAPS2 also. There are so many people that get offended by the littlest things, but they don't see that its life they will get offended more than a hand full of times in there life.           In conflusion I think that people should be able to read what they want even the books people find offensive. The offensive things Should @CAPS1 be taken off the shelves. I also feel that if children get to read some things that could be offensive then they will understand the fact that life isn't easy and you will end up being offended. Also that @CAPS1 everyone is good people, and things happen that people don't like but its life. Finally I think people should @CAPS1 have to give up reading, listening to, watching or looking at things that @MONTH1 be interesting to them""","3"
"""The world in full of offensive material, and there almost nothing we can do for it. These books that we leave behind influence the future of our society. These materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries because it is part of a large varity knowledge and the library is not the last place someone will look for such material.      On the logical side of this, the more a person knows the more power one has. That doesn't mean that some items such as centain types of music of movies are inapropate his or her age. Some partents get really  offensive when they see something slightly inapropate but the thing to remember is that, those so called little children will sooner or later see such items; it is just a part of growing up.      In the last paragraph, it suggested that a person should have large mass of imformation to choose from becasue there is not a perfect little soul and everyone has amounts of cruiosity. For example somethings like @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 are taught in school and could be consided dangerous. In @ORGANIZATION1 we learn the ways of atoms and  make make perdictions of how they will react with other chemicals. When in the lab, students are required to wear safety material because of the dangerous enviroment. The same goes for @CAPS1, one learns about how to live a healthy life and this requires students to learn about the human body such as the reproductive systems. In these @CAPS3 we learn better how the world works around us and with this we learn things that can be dangerous.     With everything that we do there is postive and negative outcomes. What I am suggesting is that, we need to find a healthy balance of what is really needed and the materials that are strickly entertainment, and those items should be removed. If it has some purpose behind it, then it holds a place but if it is some magazine talking about drama it apears very useless.      In this large world there alway was and always will be people or material that are a bad influnce. Yet this is all a matter of perception and everyone has different torances and values.

There are many problems with entertainment today in my oppinion. They include things now that show a lot of violence and intimacy; which @MONTH1 not be fit for some people.  I don't think they should take them off the shelves, but simply rate them so everyone knows what to expect. Movies are rated because some people don't want or need to see what will happen in them. While some of it is not appropriate, other parts of it guide us. It's almost like they are preparing us for the worst, but are hoping for the best. We see what happens to one person in these articles of entertainment, and it helps us to make sure we don't make the same mistake.       I also believe that many stories and movies inspire us to be better people and to reach for our dreams. If we see that one person can do it, we think, why can't I? Where would we be in the world if no one encouraged or pushed someone else to do what they wanted? Entertainment pushes that concept, but adds everything in it to show the reality of it.

"""I absolutely do not think that any book, movie, magazine, music, etc., should be removed from the shelf because they find it offensive.  If we do that, then all the books would be off the shelf.

I remember when I was twelve, the news was saying that a school was taking books off the shelf because it offended one person in the school.  The shocking part was that almost the whole school was reading that book.  Even teachers were reading it.  The school board did not even care though.  I think that was completely handled the wrong way.  They should have talked to the girl and said it was unfair to ask that when everybody reads it.  If it offended her, then she should not read it.     Music is an outlet for many people.  They can express their feelings in a way that is amazing.  Without music, there would not be any fun in the world.  People are alwasy listening to music.  When they are sad, mad, upset, confused, etc.  If people think some kind of music is offensive, then they should not listen to it.     Movies are going to be offensive to at least one thing all the time.  That is what makes a movie: a hero and a vilian.  We want to good guys to win.  The movie makes fun of the bad guys.  Somebody is always going to get hurt.     When I read, watch, or listen to something, I do not think of how offensive it is to me or somebody else.  I think of how the artist feels.  Why they wrote it that certain way.  If I am listening to music, I listen to the beat and the words at first.  Then if I like it, I start singing it.  If I do not like it, then I just change the song.     I hope people do not end up just taking things off the shelf when someone is offended.  We need the different opinions in life.

"""A book represents a person's beliefs and feelngs about a topic. Therefore censoring books is wrong because it goes against freedom of speech. I do not believe books, or other media should be removed because while it @MONTH1 be offensive, if it is the truth about something then we need to read about it to prevent tragedies from happening again. A person who finds a topic offensive isn't forced to read about it. If we do not accept other people beliefs, we are just as prejudice as the books we are trying to censor.      Many books that are threatened by censorship are books about historical facts, such as the holocaust. I think we have the right to know about important events. For one reason, if we forget about such things, than they are more likely to be repeated. Do we really want the murder of millions of people to be repeated? Just becaused we are ashamed of something dosen't mean we should sweep it under the carpet where it can lay hidden waiting to stike again like a hungry alligator. Instead books about prejudice events should be kept out to show an example of how we shouldn't act.     While some books are censored because of shame, some are censored because a certain group of people @MONTH1 find it offensive. There is a much easier solution that censoring those books. The offended groups should just ignore the book. If it is offensive in the first place then no one should be forced to read it. The book shouldn't be forced in any other way like posters, and television broadcast. It should be kept in a certain section of a library so parties wishing to avoid it can.     The main reason for a book to be censored in the first place is because someone finds in offensive. However, isn't keeping someone from saying something just as offensive? To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 is a big target for censorship, but it is about treating everyone fairly. If that book like that was censored, it would be like saying some people are better than others. Another big target for censorship in some countries is the @CAPS3. Censoring that book would basically tell the @CAPS4 population that they are wrong.     Censoring something is wrong. Not only could it cause sad events to repeat themselves, offended parties can just simply avoid the book. While some books offend people, censoring a book can be just as offensive to other parties. The simplest thing to do is to leave it up to the reader to decid if they should read it, or not.""","4"
"""There are many types of materials in the library to entertain you. Some of these materials @MONTH1 be books, magazines, movies, and music. Each person has their own type of information and genres that they like. For example, most teenage girls love to read young romance stories, and about young peoples' lives; @CAPS1 people like informational books. Everyone is different in their own way. The material they choose to read is their own choice.           How would you feel if one of your favorite books or magazine were taken off the shelves of all the libraries? You would probably wonder why such a thing would happen. Well, some people would like to argue about how some of the information that is contained in such materials are offensive or innapropriate. They want these types of things to be taken off the shelves. But is it their decision to say that some things offend people?                       Everyone has their own opinion and can make their own choice on what they want to read or what they do not want to read. In my opinion, these types of materials should stay on the shelves. It is simple, if you do not like a certain genre of magazines or books, do not read them. If you hear someones music, and it sounds completely awful to you, then just walk away or listen to your own music. Theres a new movie out about how the world is going to end, and you disbelieve in the fact that the world will not end that way, do not go and see it.      Some parents do not want their children to know about some of the things that are out there in the world, which is completely understandable. But, everyone has rights to what they want to know and what they do not want to know. If everyone had a right to take away some books that they think are not appropriate, do you think there would be any books left? The thing is, is that in today's society, people want to do what they want and think what they want. Some people do not agree with most things, but that is something they will have to face, because not everyone can be happy""","4"
"""Should certain materials be removed from the shelves of the library that are found offensive? @PERSON1 states that we will have no books left of the shelf to read if everyone removes a book they do not approve of. What some people think is the most innocent book, could offend another individual. Different people find different topics offensive. No two people think the same.     Though certain books or magazines @MONTH1 have offensive subjects or materials in them, if they were to be removed, how would we learn? For example, say there was a historical fiction book about racism. The book might show different perspectives of how people lived when racism flourished. Readers could learn from the books how racism affects people, and why it is wrong. Learning about dislikes can make someone more knowledgable on why some people think the way they do. The readers can learn from mistakes made in the past. Books or movies depict how life was years or even centuries ago; morals were different a while ago from what they are now.     If many people were to agree that a certain material is very offensive or not appropriate for adolescents or young children, one option that could be available is only allowing adults to check it out. The library could also put a warning on it if they think the content of the material is too harsh. Another idea could be setting up reviews on a website with a list of each book in the library. Consumers can read the review first and then decide whether to check it out or not.     People have their own opinions and views on materials. A person should learn to be tolerant of materials; others might truely enjoy it. This article might be offensive to those who read it, because they might think things should be more sensored rather than tolerated.  If someone does not like the material, they are not forced to check it out of the library so why cause a fuss over it? One person might find a topic very offensive while that same topic sparks interest in another individual. Each person has different morals so who is to say what should and should not be in a library?""","3"
"""One essential right that every man, woman, or child should have is the freedom of speech. Without this right no one would be able to express their views. When libraries pull books, magazines, movies, and music off of their shelves it takes away that right. Even if the matter of the subject is offensive to some people, the books or other items should be left on the shelves.      What one person finds offensive another could find miraculous. If one person does not find the content of a book attractive then simply do not read the book. Libraries should not censor the material that they put on the shelves just because someone does not like it. I do think however, that books should be placed in the secton that they belong. Sections for childrens books, young adult books, adult books, and many more can all be found in a library. An example would be that a book about the anatomy of the human body does not belong in the childrens section. beyond this, the library should leave the rest of the decisons to the reader. If someone wanted to read a book on the @LOCATION1, then that person should be able to go to a library and check the book out. The problem with censorship is that a @CAPS1 could find the book offensive and want it removed from the shelves. Then the person interested in the @LOCATION1 would not be able to withdrawl the book.     The choice of what material you read should be left up to you, not restricted by what someone else finds offensive. Libraries should not remove items from their shelves if someone else finds it offensive to their own beliefs. The person should just not read the book. Everyone is going to have a different opinion on most things and therefore, there should not be censorship in libraries""","3"
"""Writing is a way to express one's thoughts and ideas on a page. In this country, an author can write freely about whatever he desires and he is not subject to penalty for doing so. Sometimes reading these works can be enjoyable, other times it can be rather disturbing. However, just because a work is offensive does not mean that it is not worth reading. Books, manuscripts, and other forms of literature should not be taken off the shelves even if they are disturbing or offensive.      The @CAPS1, a book written by @PERSON2, revealed the horrible practices of the meat packing industry. It was offensive to many, and in addition it caused an uprising among @CAPS2 because of its content. However, there is a reason that book is still talked about today. If there had been laws prohibiting him from writing about the horrific things that were taking place in those factories, it is quite possible and actually very likely that the industry wouldn't have been reformed for a long time. Fortunately, @PERSON2 exposed the horrific processes that took place in the industry and the government stepped in and solved the problem. Someone out there hates this book, and hated it from the day it was published. But that doesn't mean he has the right to remove it from the shelves and prevent all others from reading it.     Too often students are forced to read works of fiction and stories that, although they are beneficial for students, do not inform students about the world in which they find themselves. It is important for a student to read @ORGANIZATION1, and the works @PERSON4 and @LOCATION1. However, students must learn and begin to understand the world in which they currently find themselves, the eras of the past, and the circumstances that they will find themselves in for decades to come. They must learn how to become successful in life. They should read works by @PERSON1, such as @CAPS3, which essentially tells the story of success and what seperates the average from the great. Someone out there hates these works, and he should not have the right to ruin the opportunity that these books and short stories could give someone else.     Reading is the best way to learn. In a world of social networking and 'screens' of all types, the importance of reading has been diminished. Students must develop a love of reading, and if everyone who hates a book takes it off the shelves, then, as Paterson said, 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'

"""Dear Newspaper,      I beleive that no book should be taken off the selfs for nay reason. People @MONTH1 not be mature enough for some books, music, magazines, etc., and so the libraries that have a problem with some of the materials then maybe they should put a limit to age on checking out certain things. Libraires keep all types of books and magazines so what would be their reason to take the material off the self? I think that there are different types of people in the world and everyones going to wnat to read something different.        If libraries are going to take the material off the self that people don't like then the material that others like would be gone. For instance,if i were to take the '@CAPS1' series off the selves then all the '@CAPS1' fans would be ferious and upset. But knowing that lots of people like the series, my library isn't going to do that. There is alot of books that parents don't want their children to read, but libraries arn't going to take them off the selfs.     Some parents arn't going to want their children and teenagers to read a romantic, rasy book but thats what other adults enjoy reading. Those books arn't going to go away but if parents have problems with it then maybe they should mention to the library to put an age limit to them. The parents could also check on what their child or teenager is reading. But those books will be in libraries forever and you can't make them go away because you don't want you're chilren to read them.     From experiance, I've read a couple racy books and they are disturbing for me, being an imatture addiunce. But i'm not going to ask for the books to be taken off the self. Some books are very vulger and nasty in the ways they discribe fights or wars or abuse but some people like readinf lititure like that so the libraries will keep them. If peoplehave problems with books then stay away from them and don't read them. Its as simple as that.      In conclusion, I think all books should stay on the shelves because all people have different interest and opinions. If anyone has a problem with a book for being racy or vulgur then they shouldn't ready that book, and if they dont want their childrena and teenagers to read the book either then they should be a parent and not let them. They can't blame the library for books they don't want their kids to read because thats not fair to the people who enjoy those books and like to read them.

"""From many thoughts and arguments people disagree with the school libraries. The main reason is because of the books, magazines, ariticles, and internet that contains content very disturbing for children. Such content requires material as violence, drugs, and nudity. In this argument, parents do not like the fact that their kids have resources to uncensored content. Or perhaps the parents do not care about what their children have access to.        Today libraries are not focused on the materials that they have on their shelves. That is how children could get the idea in being a 'bad kid' in school. They think it is cool seeing someone else doing drugs, violence, or nudity. But if the libraries have censored content in the library, then kids would not enjoy it if they would have uncensored content. In the parents thoughts, uncensored content should be kept away from children.      The libraries should be more responsible with the content that they have on their shelves. They either do or do not know that they have offensive content in their library. They need to remove all offensive and uncensored content from their shelves for the children. It is not right for the kids to see any offensive or uncensored material.           Their are parents who have kids in school, who do not care about what they learn or what they do. Parents should be more concerned about what their kids are learning everyday. Then they can at least teach their childern about uncensored content.      Parents and libraries should be more responsible about the offensive content that the children could possibly have access to. Children should not see any of the content because it is not right for a child. The falt goes to the parents and the libraries. They should be aware of the material that the children are looking at""","4"
"""Do you want your nine year old @CAPS2 talking and reading about inappropreite subjects such as sexual relationships or language? No! I know I wouldn't for my @CAPS2. I think books that are offensive and inappropreite shouldn't be in @LOCATION1 school or elementray schools with little ones or even @NUM1 years olds. And parents should be in conrol of what thier kids watch and listen too.     Honstley we can't control how people make movies or what singers are saying in songs but we can control who listens to them and watches them. Its the parents that are the only ones who can control thier children, no one else.     In libraries I feel like its the librarians who are the cause for letting children read offensive books. And I don't mean any disrespect but wouldn't you agree? I mean think about it, librarians are the ones in control of the books that are in the library, and I think that they should make sure that the book young teens are checking out are appropraite enough for them to read. Ones that don't involve sex or violence that @NUM1 year olds shouldn't be reading.     Here's an idea, maybe libraries should have @DATE1 year olds sign a paper or have a certain card with them that allows them to check out that certain book or @CAPS4. And it should have parents permisson on it showing that the parents approve of this. But I think high schoolers should only be aloud to do this because they are more mature than younger ones. They know better than to start fights or cuss in school.          All I'm saying is that I DO agree with this problem, parents are the reason thier kids are immature and rude because they @CAPS1 thier children get away with the attitude and rudeness. So yes parents and other people do have the right to sensor movies and book, etc.     But what about @CAPS4 theaters you ask? DONT @CAPS1 YOUR @CAPS2 @CAPS3 TO THE @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 YOU!!! It's that simple. Students in high school @CAPS3 to the @CAPS5 after school with friends and get in to see rated @CAPS7 movies @CAPS6 parents. And I do believe that some of them use fake @CAPS8 so they don't need a parent with them. Teens will @CAPS3 home that night and want to re-enact what they saw in the @CAPS4. Even if it's sex, or fights or even language. It's really sad that parents allow this to happen and I think the parents should grow up and disapline thier students. I've seen to many parents letting thier children get away with thier mouth and attitude. Most of my friends parents @CAPS1 thier children get away with everything.      One of my friends is really bad at getting what she wants. She told me that all she has to do is cry and she gets what she wants. I don't always get what I want and I don't want every new thing out there because I don't deserve it. I have to earn to get a new phone or a laptop. I ask my parents and they eaither say we don't have enough money or you don't need it and I just move on with my life. But I don't @CAPS1 books or movies control my life and change who I am. Those things aren't that important. I mean the ones that talk about school or some random story that some stranger wrote and it just happened to show up in the school libraries. The stories or movies, etc., that teens should really pay attention to are the edicational ones. The ones that teach us about life and society. About the future and teach us how life is as an adult and ready us for the real world. Because once those seniors open those high school doors and graduate it's no more staying up late and sleeping in and parting on the weekends. Its the real world, the adult world.     So please read this carefully and I hope what I have said has helped you realize why people sensor these things. Why kids are acting the way they are. Libraries should sensor certain things and not allow students below high school to read them.

"""In this millenium we really should'nt be to concerned about censorhip. People say so way worse in puplic and do worse things in public. On the other side of this, the parents of a child should be watching their kid and looking to see what they are about to grab off the shelf. Its the parents fault if their child gets ahold of a book that has adult content on or in it. So why should we have censorship?                                                                             If a cd contains adult content and the child is underage and grabs it off the shelf listening to it, then its the parents fault for not being responsible enough to watch their child. Same goes for books and etc.. Now if the child is old enough to understand what they grab then they should be able to listen to it, and ask questions about it. If its about adult relationships and the child takes it, then the parent should explain it all and tell them what is going on. The parent should be the one to take responsibility.                           Now, if a book, music, movie, magazine, and ect.contain raceism in it then it should be censored, unless its about history. Kids under the age of teen usally repeat what they hear or read. Same goes for teenagers too actualy! Books with the wrong kind of words in it should be kept safe or there should be a age to where you can get it. The world has enough horrid language in it, why should the library add to it by letting kids get ahold of these books and repeating what they hear.                  I remember when I was walking around a library and I saw a little kid not older than @NUM1 grab an adult book and started to open it and look through it. The parent was no where to be seen nor heard, who leaves their child in a book section like that? This young boy put the book down on the hard floor and started to take off his clothes. This was no ones fault, wasnt the library, wasnt mine. People should take responsibility, control their kids and if they can't then leave them at home!                                                        There are also certain people who need book for research and need to take home books for their projects. We should'nt have censorship and take down all the books that should be contained from kids. Some of us need those kind of books in order for us to do our research and projects!      No we should'nt have censorship in our libraries! Im not about to be able to miss a project or miss a good movie because some parents don't know how to control their kids and watch what they grab. We should be able to keep all the books, movies, magazines, and ect., there could be a way to censor most books but they would need their own shelf, and they could be a age lemit or a pass people could use. That would take to long to do so though. So keep our libraries filled with interesting things without censoring them!""","4"
"""Libraries, to myself, are a gateway to another world; where I can be who I want to be, and let my imagination wander where ever it pleases. Libraries should not have the ability to take a book off the shelves depending on it's content. We are all different people, we all don't enjoy the same kind of books. Also, some books @MONTH1 be needed for research. Censorship in a library should not be allowed.     First, there are so many different people in the world.

Books can not be taken off the shelf just for their content. That content might be a whole other world for a young child.      Next, libraries are used so often by college students to writer papers for school. Books are needed for research. For an example, you're a college student writing a research paper on abuse--including sexual, physical, and mental. A young author writes a non-fiction novel about her childhood ranging from being raped by her father at six years old to being bullied in school. After hours of searching, you find all local libraries have removed @CAPS4 book for it's explicit content. College students need books no matter what they're about.     Libraries are open to people of all age. It is understandable that a twelve year old could easily get a hold of a book inappropriate for their age level, but that's why libraries are split into sections.

"""Libraries are our way of knowing what has happened in the past whether it is all fact or maybe fiction.  No matter what type of book it is, it still tells us a story of another place and another time. Libraries should not be censored.     Taking away one book because of one sentence that seems vulgar and inapropriate for young readers is wrong.  I understand that reading books with adult material such as drug abuse and sexuality can lead to experimentation but is that not life?  At least once in our exsistance on earth we find ourselves curious about something at we try it, just to see what it is like.  It is all a learning experience.      History would most likely be the touchiest subject in our libraries mainly because we are asshamed of what we acted like thirty plus years ago, discrimination in @LOCATION1, the @CAPS1, and now the wars in the middle east.  Some countries do not even teach their own history to students in school because they are embarrassed of what happened or afraid that it might happen again if the students know @CAPS6, why and what happened.  Reading and knowing about what our ancestors did will help us lead a better future not distroy it.      Today's media has overflowed with adult material not suitable for kids under @NUM1.  If anything we need to start censoring what we broadcast on television and also what we post on the @CAPS4 and leave our libraries alone. Most of the books that are in our libraries has been there for like forty years so it is completely pointless to remove it when it has already educated young minds for over forty years.      I truthfully do not know why you would want to remove books or censor them with a sharpie marker.  All that is doing is giving readers less material to read.  In @LOCATION2, elementary educators are not required to teach their students @CAPS6 to spell, at all. I walked into a third grade classroom and watched a girl spell @CAPS2 '@CAPS3' thinking that was the correct why to spell @CAPS2.  The @ORGANIZATION1's excuse for not having teachers teach @CAPS6 to spell is that they should learn that from reading books everyday.  Well guess what @LOCATION2, with the @CAPS4, gaming systems and iPods, little kids are not taking to reading like they did ten years ago and we are going to have a lot of future adults not know @CAPS6 to read and this is what it is going to be like.      '@CAPS5 @CAPS6 do you spell encyclopedia?'     '@CAPS6 should i know, I wasn't taught @CAPS6 to spell in @LOCATION2.'     You see what I mean, so if you are going to take away the ability to spell you better not take away our books becuase they are the only things teaching our @ORGANIZATION1's future on @CAPS6 to spell simple words.        Today we have the @CAPS4, gaming systems, iPods and @CAPS8 to intertain us on a daily basis.  No one is taking to reading as a way to relieve boredom, they are just sitting on the couch watching television.  And now if you reduce reading material for teens and young readers you are not incouraging us to read.  You are taking away all of the interesting parts of a book.  To be truthfull I will read and reread a book many times over if it is a good story with some extra sizzle.  I do not enjoy books that do not have drugs, alcohol, family stress, war stories or even some sexuality mainly because books without that are boring.  When i read books like that they make me feel better about my life and @CAPS6 I interact with others.  I have learned @CAPS6 to deal with all of those things from books.

If we started removing books, movies etc. from out of our libraries for being offensive, where would we draw the line between offensive and not? To remove even one book from a library for offending a certain race or culture, would be the beging of a tornado of books being removed by eveyone who has ever not agreed with what is said about them or about their culture and lifestyles. Now, let's stop and think about what it means for somthing to be offensive in the first place. People are offended by things in out world every day and books and movies in our libraries are probably pretty low down on the offensive totem pole next to say the internet or news I would think, wouldn't you?. Plus, the materials we provide to our libraries with are for people too learn and teach, they arn't made to be offensive or rude and in my experience with libraries being a @NUM1+ year user I have never found anything to be offesive or hurtful to anyone.In my conclusion there are just too many books about to many subjects already written to even begin to go through which ones are offensive or not and too whom.

Wait, you don't want that piece? What are you going to do with it? Do you take all of the same pieces that you don't like out of the bowl and throw them away, or do you simply drop it back into the bowl and choose a new one? If you throw the candy away, what does that mean for the other party guests? You have narrowed their choices down because of your own selfish opinion. That candy could have been the guest favorite. But, since YOU don't like it, you take away the other guests' privilege to eat that candy. They didn't deserve that, now did they?     If you're searching through books in a library and you come across a book that doesn't interest you or offends you, then put it back and look for a new one. If you're having trouble finding the right book, ask the librarian for suggestions on other topics or books to check out. Go to a new library, even, but don't mess with something that isn't yours. Especially, something as small as a book.     The point of the matter is, if you don't like something then disregard it. The moment the book, and the book alone, starts causing problems is the moment anyone should intervene. But, come on, do you really think a book could cause a problem? If your child is having problems, don't you think you ought to check what's going on with him instead of looking to see if he/she checked out the 'book that we hope none of our children' took off the shelf.

For example, in political cartoon inside of newspapers, @PERSON1 is sometimes compared with a @CAPS1. We as @CAPS2 @CAPS3 take it very offensive when they are called someone in our own race a @CAPS1. I take that very offensive because, back during the time when black were not able to do certain thing, the whites would refer to blacks as monkeys.      I being offened is not a good thing, and they last place they need offensive stuff is in the libraries. Libraries are suppose to hold positive material on the shevles. Book that give knowledge to people in need, not thing contain negative depictions of human life. Also children should be able to pick up a book, and not feel offened by it.      One night my little brother came home with a book that he got for the library. It was about a white dog and a dark colored dog together trying to find food and a place to sleep. But one day the dark colored dog was lefted out in the cold while a loving family toke in the white dog , into their warm home. My brother feel so uncomfortable with that book, he decided to take it back that same night.     Libraries can contain very offensive things that can make a person sick to their stomachs. Offensive thing can hurt a persons feelings, and libraries should be the last place where a person should feel uncomfortable reading a book. Eventhough my brother found a book that he disliked, he still continues to go to the library to find excellent books to read. Libraries are fun to go to, but they can contain very offensive thing that can hurt a person's feelings.""","3"
"""Censorship is found on television, in libraries, in schools, and even in homes. Do you think that censorship should be used? Censorship can be used to block one's personal thoughts and opinions to promote conformism. I disagree with the idea of Censorship. Not everyone thinks people should be able to have their own images and visions; however, that is what makes our world so individualized.     Censorship in libraries is growing more and more gradually. The government does not want the society, especially the youth, of @LOCATION1 to read things that are deemed inappropriate. Should that not be up to one's guardian, or if they are old enough, to oneself? When you read books, you see language being block out, they take parts out to make the book seem more classy, also they block out things such as drugs and alcohol. A lot of people believe that books are what hurt a lot of today's society. I believe that reading material could be a lot more educational if the editors woud leave some of the things that they censor, in the book. I believe this because, if parents decide to not let their child read a story that is up to them; however, their child could learn about certain situations and possibly learn how to handle those difficult things.     This opinion that censorship in books could be absolutely debatable. Censorship such as in the book, @ORGANIZATION1 is being used. The government is taking out certain words in this story because they are seen as offensive. This is understandable also. I do not believe this amazing novel should be seen in this way. The language was not meaning to be used offensively, but simply to state how people talked and how things were when @PERSON1 was alive. If it were not for books like this, how would out society learn about not only @LOCATION1's history, but other culture's history? In all fairness, @ORGANIZATION1 is an educational novel about how times were in the day of @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1.     Censorship in movies is also growing. Television will block out things such as language, nudity, alcohol, drugs, and things of that nature. I would not like to turn on the television and see these things everywhere, but it could educate people on what and what not to do. I believe if censorship were not used, people's thoughts would be more apt to imagine. Imagination can scare people. Some think that imagination can turn someone crazy or into doing something that is not normal; but what is normal? It is to the community, doing what everyone else is doing and not being different, this scares people.     This whole essay brings me back to the thought that censorship is basically conformism. The word conformism means to all become one; to conform. If this is the case no one will ever come up with new books, music, movies, magazines, or ideas; we will all just be citizens of @LOCATION1 or any other culture trapped inside our very own minds""","5"
"wow thats racist. as i said when i saw the movi white men cant jump. yes that movie could have afended me a lot but it didnt personaly i thought it was funny i enjoyed it cuase its true statistics say black people can jump higher then white people. its all on how you look at it you have to have a sense of humor when it comes to stuff like that.      everyone remembers sometime when someone said something offensive to them. but its your choice to take that to heart or just laugh about it. life is so much easyer when u dont cry over every little thing that someone said to you. see now i have a since of humor. when i was in that movie i was laughing so hard i almost peed myself. i didnt care that it singled out white people so what its funny.     to kill a mochinburd was also a book that a lot of people called offensive and i can see why. it had the @CAPS1 word in there a lot. but back then it was a different time the people in the book werent saying it to you so why would you be offended by it. he wasnt offending you.      if you take little things like that to your heart then you will have a tough time going through life. somethings you just have to let go and roll off your body.     in conclusion yes we have had a lot of offending stuff said to us but you cant let it get you down so much you have to move on. and if you move on you will be a better person in the long run.","3"
"""Books, music, movies, magazines, and more are a good way to learn. Some of that material is bad though, but some is good. Not all people are the same, and not all books or magazines are the same.     Books, newspapers, and magazines are good things, and they could be bad things. Some talk about nonfiction and some fiction. Others talk about famous people and all the good and mainly bad things they did this week, which is something some of us want to read but none of us should read or even write in the first place. Then there are books that have a childs story in them. There are also articles that everyone should read about, like somebody who saved a whole lot of people on @DATE1. There is a diverse amount of things to read out there, you just need to use a little discretion about what to read and put out on the shelves at a public library.     Music is another good way to express yourself. There is good old fashioned @CAPS1 music such as @ORGANIZATION1. Then there is stuff that nobody should listen to, or for that matter even sing about like almost all @CAPS2 Music. They also have little childrens songs which no matter how annoying that most of it is, it's alright for anyone to listen to. Or you can pick up some good ol' @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or any other christian artists or gospel music.The music of this world is very diverse.     The movies of today can, but most of the time aren't,be  good things. You could pick up an educational video that talks about animals that most everyone could watch. There are also bad movies such as @CAPS5 and @CAPS6.It is a horror movie that made it hard to fall asleep for a few days. Those are some that nobody should even produce.There are video copies of television shows as well, which can be alright. The vast amount of movies made today should not even be a thought in someones mind but some are good and educational.     So in conclusion, I think it should be reader and viewer discretion when it comes to content of things as this. Libraries everywhere should have most everything there is.Next time your in a library, just use discretion""","4"
"""Every library has tons of information on just about everything.  There are tons of books, music, movies, magazines and more that contain this information.  There is even some information that some people might take offence to.  On the other hand, somebody else could be perfectly fine with it.  I think that all libraries should keep all their books on the shelfs, no matter what kind of content they contain, because not everybody takes offence to some contents in books, and it is the same way vice versa.     The subject race might come into play in some books in libraries.  Books have information about people doing things to other people just because of their race.  Some people want books took out of their libraries because of the content that they contain, but really it could be a n important part of history that people need to be educated about.  Some books have words that are very offencive to people because of their skin color, relgion, or ethnic race.  This information that people need to know because thats how people were treated back then and some stuff like that still occurs today.     Libraries have all kinds of information.  I think that all the books at libraries should stay there no matter what they contain.  Even if some content is offensive some people it could still be a important part of history that people need to know""","3"
"""In my opinion, books, movies, magazines, ect., should not be taken off the shelves if they are offensive to some people. this is because everyone has different views on everything. Another reson is because for learning purposes in schools and etc. As well as authors would not want to be writting books because the books shelves are empty and their books, movies, magazines are getting rejected.     Since most people have different veiws on everything then,   every book or magazine would be taken off the shelf if they were offensive because, therefore, there would not be any book or magazine left on the shelf. This is because people think different things are offensive so what somebody thinks is offensive it @MONTH1 not be to another person. Therefore people would be angered or upset if their favorite book was taken off the shelf because someone said it was offensive.      Another problem with taking 'offensive' books of the shelf is that it would be a result in people not learning in schools and ect. This is because we all have to go through some point in school where we find something offensive for example wars, slavery, and politics. If all these books were to be taken off the shelves then nobody would be learning about any of this. In conclusion noboby would be being taught why these events happened and  why these events are wrong, so people would not have changed, they would keep doing these things because they were not taught not to. This in my opinion would cause alot of conflict between people and nobody would be educated on these events of history.      On the other hand rather than books being taken off the shelf books would not be being put on the shelfs. In this I mean that authors, producers, would not be making movies or writting books because their work just keeps getting rejected. Not only rejected but nobdy is going to go through the time and effort to make one of these for it to be rejected because it was offensive. In my opinion it would almost be impossible for these authors/ directors to make a unoffensive book or movie for everyone that is going to read or watch it.      In conclusion I have read many books in class every year that offends at least one person, but this person can choose not to finish the movie, book, or magazine if they find it offensive, or they never have to read it again. In conclusion there are many reasons why books should stay on the shelf even if they are offensive to someone. This is because it would not help with people being educated on events that happened, and people would not be reading any books in school. As well as authors would not be writting since their books are getting removed and the shelves are empty""","4"
"""Why should we be more carefull of what we get at the libary? Libaries can have books with knowledge, fun, rommance, and action or adventure, but some can be desterbing and grusium. Kids a lot of times will pick books that have pornagerfy or grusium action. This causes the kids to act in different ways. They act hyper and mean to other people or even other children. They are sneeky and do things behind the parents back. Why is because they think they need to act this way because its cool, but they don't understand this makes them look very ugly. 'So take them out' is some of the parents are saying now a days.     Even if we do take out all the books that can be bad for our children, there will not be a lot of books left. Because now a days all books have something that is bad for our mind. So why do we need to be more carefull with the books we put in our libary and the books we take out of our libary? It causes the world to change very fast.     Now libarys are a great place for kids to learn. Books can teach them new things and expand their knowledge. The libary is where all kids that have reports or essays on important people come to. Some kids go there just to get a book to enjoy. From my point of view libary is one of my most favorites places to be. Any where there are books involved count me there. Having books causes our imagination to come out and take us on adventeres that some of us will never get to do.     Sometimes books can cause things to happen in families. Some of them causes us to have nightmares or have very bad behavior. If we try to take out some of these books it will help the familes to come together, but also if we don't take out some of the books, it will cause things to go wild. Because people and kids think they need these books to survive in the world. Which really its just  the books and ect... that causes our mind to picture things that make us think we need them.      Other writing materials and even movies cause problems in this world today. Magazines can have girls with not much clothes on or other things that make boys minds wander. Movies are even worse because the picture is right there in front of their faces. I am not saying all magazines and movies are bad to our mind because they can also be helpful. Magazines can help us with research or just to now what is happening in this world today.      They also can talk on many subjects like cooking, room decerating, on how to decerate your weddings and etc... Movies can help us research and also show us what happened back then. Like watching docromentries, they are on people or what happened in our past. We don't need to take every movie or magazine out, but some we can do without.      So why do we need to be more carefull for what we put in libaries? It can cause us to have bad behavior or bad dreams. So how can we help to solve this problem? We can take out  books, magazines, movies and etc... that are really bad for our mind. So it can help our children to grow up well behavied and mature. Also one more thing books, magazines, and movies can be a very good thing if we use it right. How do we know we got a good book? We find right books for us by following our heart and our instinkes""","4"
"""Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 quote is reflecting people wanting to rid of some of the literature, books, magazines, music, and movies in libraries, because they think that the material is inappropriate.  If we got rid of all of the books from @CAPS1 world, we would have nothing left to learn from, and some of the main sources of entertainment would vanish. I believe that certain materials should not be replaced from the shelves, because the youth of today need to learn about the true past, people should learn about how cultures really are, authors and writers need to be able to express themselves, and parents should be able to control what they believe their children should and should not read.       If it were not for books and novels from the past, the current generations would have no clue of what history was about.  Children should be allowed to read books such as @ORGANIZATION1, The @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in order to get a taste of how much times have changed.  Stories from grandparents only take a person back about @NUM1 years; we need sources that can take us back thousands of years.  Some families, such as an @CAPS6 @CAPS7 family, might get offended if their children are reading books that say things like 'nigger,' but that is our history.  It is something we cannot change, and it is important for kids to know how things really were and how terrible people were treated.  We also do not want today's youth making some of the terrible mistakes generations in the past made, so they need to be taught about the real but sometimes horrendous situations.     Learning about different cultures would be another issue if books and movies were depleted.  Money is not available these days to just travel to different countries and experience their culture.  How is a young girl from a small town in @LOCATION2 supposed to find out how people in @LOCATION1 live their life?  For all she knows, the people could be living in igloos.  I believe that it is important for people to understand different cultures and religions in order to accept them in society.  Movies can teach a lot about different countries, and books do a wonderful job as well.  If they are gone, cultures would be misunderstood and forgotten.     Also, authors and directors need to be able to express themselves.  Every since people are young, they are taught that it is important to be unique and express their own style.  Not every writer is going to want to write about butterflies and rainbows.  There are people that love writing about violence, gore, and segregation.  Those things are part of the world today and everyone needs to face that reality.  Getting rid of all of those books from library shelves will not solve the problems; it would only cause people to not expect what might happen to them or @CAPS1 world.       Now, some parents @MONTH1 have hard times when their young boy comes home from school with an offensive book, but parents should have control over their kids.  If they have a problem with what their children are reading, then they should deal with that personally.  They do not need to influence other people's lives by trying to get rid of the materials off of public libraries' shelves.     Why people would even consider getting rid of history and learning materials about cultures and different subjects in @CAPS1 world is beyond me.  It would be like asking someone to rewind time so that we would not have had slavery, depressions, world wars, and homicides.  It is impossible to undo history, but we can learn about the things from the past in order to not make the same mistakes and things of the current world in order to be accepting and understanding.  Books, magazines, movies, and music are wonderful.  They represent self-expression and freedom of speech, so people should let them be an entertainment and learning source.  Without them, we would be and have nothing""","4"

They already have a childrens section if a child looks in a inappropiate book outside of the childrens section then its thier fault. I do not think it should inconvience someone to have to go elsewhere to get that cd,game,book, or movie they were looking for. It is very hard to come across a inapropiate book without looking for it on purpose. It could be a book used for teaching health or nursing class and is not meant to be inapropiate at all.

"""Who cares about unsensored things anyway? Offensive things have been around in libraries, probably since the first library opened. There has been 'offensive' things in a library for as long as i can remember. Now everyone is suppose to share there opinons on pulling these offensive books off the shelve?     What is the differnce between someone saying somthing offense or writing it? Ok, so maybe you dont want your child reading somthing unsensored, but the chances are some other child will say somthing unsensored around him. If there is a book that is so bad you wouldnt want your kids reading, why would it of been published? Publishers do read the books they publish them, they will not publish any random thing. I think that they just need to leave the unsensored things alone. If you cant be mature enough to take a article, book, or magizine seriously, then you dont need to be reading it anyway.                                         In the news or radio you always hear about some boy getting bullied and stuff at school. That isnt because of unsensored things, why dont they blame it on parents and ask where they were at? Parents look at anyone and everyone, but themselves when a kid comes home and has learned a cuss word or somthing. It is never the parents fault.

"""When you were a child how much did you learn from books?  Books are filled with great stories of far-away lands, accounts of real events, and poems with powerful meanings.  All of those books were written by an author with a clear point to make. Those books should not be censored from libraries because of words or ideas that are found offensive.  Children have to learn these things some time in their life and I think the earlier they learn the less trouble it will cause them later in life.  There are also freedoms in the @LOCATION1 that grant us freedom of speech.  Shouldn't there be a freedom to read as well?     Authors are brilliant people.  Without them, there would be no books for anybody to read.  We should all respect authors and what they put into their books.  This means when an author believes that a certain word or action fits in a book, we should leave that book alone and respect what the he or she chose to put in it.       When I was a child I picked up on everything.  I was a very inquisive as any kid my age would be.  I remember wandering around my public library scanning the rows of books and reading the titles.  There were books about politics, religion, sex, and violence.  However on the other side of the library, there were books about children escaping their own world and traveling through time in a magical tree house.  There were even stories about mice who had feelings and normal conversations amongst themselves!  The library is great because of the plethora of knowledge contained in the unrestricted inventory of books.  As I grew older, I began to dwelve into more adult books such as politics and religion.  I then formed my own personal opinions on what I gathered from the books.  Without those books in that library I would have never been able to research those topics.     There is an amendment in our @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 that  promotes freedom of speech in the @LOCATION1.  This allows for anybody to say whatever they please as long as they don't infringe upon the @CAPS2 of anybody else.  The definition of library is a place where people can read and check out books from library and return them when they please.  Libraries should allow every book in their collection because every book has some sort of value.       Taking a book out of a library because of offensive material is not right because books are important no matter what is inside of them.  Some books @MONTH1 have material that might not belong in the hands of children.  Children need to learn those things sometime in their life.  Why not now?  Books are what have taught all of us.

Another reason why I say no is because of the fact, if the book offense you then dont read the book or think about what is says just leave it alone.     The other reason why I picked yes is because if it shows some hurtful words in there towards other thats refering to the people thats its talking about then yes it needs to be removed before others start using thoes kinds of hurtfuls words to the piers or  thier elders. If the book contains racial slurs to different races then yes they need to removed asap. If others get ahold of these kinda books then everyone would use them agianst each other which in relsult of that would cause an outbreak of fights people aruging with each other, just pure hate between thoes people using it agianst the different races.

"""Should censorship be used on library books? Obviously if you are talking to an adult then yes, more than likely they don't want their pupils to be learning inappropriate words, but if you ask any student the same question you will probably get mixed answers. Some might say' I don't appreciate hearing or reading those words,' others might say' sure why not, I hear them on televison, see them on the internet, my parents say them so why can't I read them.' To me personally I don't think it's that big of a deal to have a few inappropriate words in a book, but they shouldn't be allowed on shelfs in a middle school's library or lower. High school and up I think that its okay to have on the shelves in magazines, books, music and movies.     When I was a child my mother always said don't cuss, but growing up in an enviornment where the overwhelming majority of people you talk to cuss, then after awhile it comes out like normal words. So why not have it in the books, and movies? It's not like we don't know what the words mean. If they hurt your feelings then you know not to read, listen or watch it again. I'm not saying cuss words are good and that it's ok for them to be in every sentence you say, but hearing or reading a few won't kill you.     In some cases, cuss words are good for a story. Sometimes your reading a book and someone gets in an argument, you don't even realize it till the argument is over, but with sometimes when there is a cuss word, you stop and say,' @CAPS1 something is going on here, and I want to know what it is.' @CAPS2 catches your attention and keeps you hooked on whatever it is until you find out what happened.     Consequently; movies, books, music, and magazines with foul language does have an affect on our youth.  A lot of children are cussing at an early age, but thats just how people communicate, show emotions, and get someones attention. Censorship can take away a lot from a book, overall making it less interesting, so again I believe censorship should not be a deciding factor in choosing a book, movie, music or magazine. Choose it because it looks interesting and its something you might enjoy""","3"
"""There are many books that are offensive to people. I personally agree. There are many things that shouldn't be seen by children.There is alot of material out there, weather its books, movie, and other things that have a bad influences on children. Children learn by watching and observing. They learn from us and our generation. What better way to protect them than by removing their bad influences.     First, children watch movies and they see to people kissing and one thing leads to another. Some movies even show people having sex. What kind of influence is that on the children. Than the children learn and they go out there and do the same thing. Teen pregnacies have jumped threw the roof. High @CAPS1 are filled with pregnant teens. Any where you go I garentee you will see a pragnant teen. Some girls even get pragnant right after they have developed and were able to have kids. Now imagine if we were able to stop that. Theres a way; dont let the children watch these programs, that way they won't be tempted.     Secondly, there are books and movies and other things that show the children shooting and killings and how people get away with it. This could be a very bad influence. There are video games with shootings and have limbs flying all over the place. Well the children will learn from those video games and movies. They think that killing someone is ok and you can get away with it. Bad influences like that make the children think it's ok to do things like that.There have been children who have killed their parents for a video game. Then the children become cereal killers or go on a shooting spry at school. Is that not much evidence at all to show the people that something is wrong. We need to take imediate control of this situation and stop it before one day you see your child on television for killing someone.        Finally, all the children are getting lazier. All children do is lay down and watch tv or play video games. Their lazyness causes obesity. Their are many kids to whom this topic refers to. No parent wants to see their kid over weight for many reasons. Children being obeast causes lots of depression. The child feels sad because they feel ugly and they lose self esteem. Thechild then becomes shy and quiet. In some cases the child trys to comit suicide because otherchildren are teasing them in school everyday. I know any parent wouldn't want their kid to die. These are things that are happening and parents need to open their eyes and see whats happening before its to late.      In conclusion, to prevent all these catastrophies their has to be change. Their are many harmful and bad influences out their today that can determine the childrens futures. There still time for change, so lets do something about it. Lets try to reduce teen pregnancies, bad influencial video games or movies, and instead of watching movies and playing video games all day get up go outside and go for a walk. These are little things we can do to make a change for good""","4"
"""I @CAPS1'@CAPS2 think that books should be censored. There are no books, besides maybe math books, that @CAPS1'@CAPS2 offend at least one person or a group of people. Books are an important part of the learning system. If a certain book offends you then you @CAPS1'@CAPS2 have to @CAPS3 @CAPS4. @CAPS4's that simple. there is no need to over react to words on paper. Besides there are more important issues at the moment.     While being offended by a book is bad, we must realize that some people are going through things that are way worse than that. People who do drugs or have a family member that does drugs are an example. A better example would be the parents or gaurdians of a kid who was killed either by accident or on purpose. One of the most common but overlooked examples is the what the loved ones of people who die serving our country go through. As you can see if people can live with that then we can definantly handle an offensive book.      Censorship causes blidness. What I mean is, if we censor one offensive book then we have to censor every book that someone finds offensive. All men are created equal, right? So they'd have to censor the book. If a book offends you that much then listen up, @CAPS1'@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4! Just because a book is offensive to you doesn'@CAPS2 mean @CAPS4's offensive to everyone. sometimes a history book could be considered offensive so we censor @CAPS4 and then we @CAPS1'@CAPS2 learn about the mistakes of our past and repeat them. The point is if a p erson can handle some of the things I've mentioned, then we can all handle a little bit of words on a little bit of paper.""","4"

It's hard, unforgiving, and it kicks you in the teeth. You've just got to learn to adapt to it. And censorship in libraries, on @CAPS1 etc, won't and aren't helping matters in the least bit. I guess I don't understand why we have to care so much. If everybody just relaxed a little and focused on themselves, we would be fine. Everytime I hear the word 'offensive' it makes me sick to my stomach, because in my eyes, that word doesn't exist. It's a made up word that really means we care about other peoples feelings more then we do our own""","3"
"""I don't Believe in censorship of libraries. Were @CAPS1 we live in a free country, and have the right to have access to the matrial we want from libraries. It doesnt matter if its age aproprite or not. If you dont want your kids listening to that bad rap artist, or watching that @CAPS2 rated movie, then its your responsibility as a parent to keep it from them.     Part of what makes @LOCATION1 so great is the freedom that come with living here. If we allowed anyone to censor a library then we would have no books to read, movies to watch, or music to listen to. Katherine paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hompe none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' this quote shows that if anyone had the right to pull a book from the shelf we wouldnt have any books left.     Censorship would just be the start.It could lead to the government censoring information from the public that they don't want us to know. which would take away the greatness of @LOCATION1, we wouldn't be free.     Censorship of libraries would take away our rights. witch is why i apose it""","3"
"""Should books, magazines, music, movies, and ect. be censored for certin age levels? No they should'ent. Books can be very educational. Sometimes you can't even find a book with out bad things in them. Even if they do, sometimes it's the only way to learn some of the rich history of our country.     Books can't be censored from children. Why you ask? Because the reason people read books is to learn. To learn about love, math, history, and much more. These books are writen by adults, not for adults, but for everyone to read. I read lots of books, and every book that I read I learn someting new.     Back in the ninetinth and twentith centerys, cursing was huge in books. But it wasent just to curse, it was to show the full dioulge of the character. It also set the mood of the era, and the place, where the story is being held. Such as in war books the characters curse a lot. The reason for this is that if a man gets shot in the leg and all he said was,' @CAPS1!!' That isn't how the character would act. The man would curse his lungs out. Not literly but when the author writes what someone would truely say, the reader will have a better understanding of the characters in the book.     As the quote says, everyone has the same right to read, which is true. Its true because everyone has a right to be interested and learn about what they are interested in. Right? I myself strongly belive they everyone should choose what they want to learn about, and then have the freedom to do that.     So should books in a library be censored? No defenitly not. its the best way for people to learn what life is really like. Sometimes you can learn anything with out reading a book with curse words, sex, or violance. People worry that reading books like this will create bad people if they learn these things at a younger age. But it wont, it will only show them how not to act. And can only create a better person.""","4"
"""I belive if the books, music, movies, magazines and etc. are offensive and are bad that they should be removed, the reason being is because of younger children.       Younger children are not aloud to be exsposed to that stuff if it's bad or not pertand to them. Since there are books, music, movies, magazines and etc. that are bad and offensive, then I would suggest a room or some sort of place that they can be held and were only adualts can be around them and can get to them.      Movies and magazines are my biggest thing that would worry me. There are more bad things in them then in books or music. Books and music have bad language but very rarely have bad images or other things like that. If there happen to be a book, music, movie, or magzine that you or any other person thinks that is inaproprete or offensive then you or that person would have permision to take it off and show it the main desk, and let them know what you think about it.     I feel that they should seperated the censorship in libraries to keep the children safe. They should steel be aloud to have censorship books, music, movies, and magazines because adult can handle that kind of material to where younger children can't. So therefore to keep everything sepreate, and there shouldnt be no problem.""","3"
"""Many people are very stern about there thoughts when they believe in something very strongly.  In other peoples eyes you @MONTH1 find some who disagree and do agree with you from having similar life experiences.  All of which peoples opinions are created by life experiences and many tragedy' they have been apart of.  You will find sooner or later that some of the problems that many people deal with, that there is someone who has a lot worse than you do and that you should enjoy every moment you can.     Opinions are alternated often about many different things, being a homosexual is one of the many that people debate about most often.  In my opinion it doesn't really matter whether your homosexual or not you have to understand that everyone is different in there own way.  Exceptence is what' key to making eveyone get along at some point, but people struggle with homophobia.       Another big debate that many people have are with female and male opinions.  It seems as if they dont get along because they disagree, but neither could live without each other.  It's nearly impossible to find a male or female who agree' with you @PERCENT1, unless there pretending to be something there not.  From life experiences from parents arguing, friends fighting, and other relatives you see people forgive and forget so easily because the world is supposed to gifted and cherished everyday.     All in all I believe that most books are based off of reality and other peoples visions on the world and what they see.  I also find it interesting when people are very dramatic when trying to get there point across.  It helps others get a clear picture of who and what they go through.""","3"
"""I believe that all the books are meant to be in the library. People would not want them gone if they thought of it the way I do. It makes sense that we need all sorts of books to learn from. Some books @MONTH1 seem bad, but when you think about it there is always a good lesson to be learned. There are many different reasons why all books should stay on the shelf, but here are a couple of mine.     Two years ago there was a boy named @PERSON1. On many occations he found himself in bad situations that he did not know how to deal with. Many parents do not talk to their kids about certain things, such as drugs. This makes kids unaware and curious to figure out the truth. He had no other way of figuring out about how to handle fights, drugs, and alcohol unless he read about them in a book.      When he was almost sixteen years old he began to hang out with a bad group of teenagers. They were going to take @PERSON1 to a party. @PERSON1 secretly left his house and went because he was curious. When he got to the party, everybody began to drink. He knew that he always wanted to try it, yet he was not going to because he had to be home before his parents got up at five the next morning.      After several hours of setting on a couch watching everybody else do it, they finally had him talked into it. He figured that one would not hurt. Well before long, one became two, two became four, and it just kept going up. @PERSON1 was having so much fun that he lost track of time. He looked at the clock and it was three a.m., he got really worried.     He didn't know what to do until he thought back to a book he read. The book was about a guy who was out drinking, the guy had know other way home than to drive. The guy decided he would just drive home because he was not very drunk. When he was driving home he pulled out on a highway at the wrong time. A semi hit him in the left side of his car.       After thinking about that book he decided to be brave and call his parents. @PERSON1 knew that he would get punished, but he decided that grounding would be better than injury, or even death. @PERSON1 had his dad come get him from the party. He was grounded for two months. It would have been longer if his parents had not been so proud of his decision in the end. @PERSON1 was happy with his decision as well.     Events such as that are the exact reason why I think that almost any book belongs on the shelf. The story in wach book helps everybody comprehend what should be done in a real life situations. I know that books help me figure out many things. Even what to do and what not to do. If you just give every book a chance you will find a good reason for it to be read""","3"
"""Do I think that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be romoved from shelves if they are found offensive? Yes, I think they should be romoved from the shevles if they are found offensive to some or the majority of people. Some can be a bad influence on younger kids. Some can be offensive to someone's race or religion. It could also be offensive to people based on who they are or what they do.                                                                                                                  Some materials should be romoved because of the kind of infuence they have on younger kids. Some books can have violent language and actions in the book. Most magazines have inappropiate articles that they should not be reading or even looking at. The music nowadays are very explicit and do not need to be in hands of kids. Some parents don't even care about the music but it is one of the biggest influential things out. So that's one reason why certain books, music, and magazines should be romved from shelves.

"""The library is a pathway to knowledge, which branches to many different cultural roads. It has expanded from just a place of books to a building which also houses music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media. But, there begs the question if certain materials should be excluded if they deemed to be offensive. There are many ways to approach this question.     Is censorship an answer to offensive materials or an answer to what is not 'politically correct'? Often, people will claim certain work to be unjust without understanding the viewpoint of the supposed victim. It is quite ironic that the people with the power - who stand up for offended parties - often do not understand them more than the creator of the work.      Another reason for censorship is to protect children from unwanted material, which is very understandable. But, where in the process do parents have control of what exactly they want their children to access. I believe it is the resposiblity of the parent to determine such restrictions. If a parent gives a child unlimited access to material at a library, then the child should be able to explore wherever their curiosity takes them. If the parent chooses to limit access, then they should be active in the process of selection. It is the right of the individuals who birthed and raise these kids to determine how they are guided.     I myself am a musician, which is no more artistic in a sense than any other creator, such as an author. My creations are expressions that I give for world to enjoy and think about. To remove the work of an author in a library is to damage his ability to spread his thoughts. Of course, there are other outlets to acquire books, but the library is one of the greatest outlets.     There are a couple complications that will arise in censorship on libraries. What guidlines do you have in determing excluding the offensive materials? If a material offends one person, is that sufficient enough to exclude it, or do you need a larger group? It is unrealistic to always get a complete consensus of a group's opinion, so how do you determine whats offensive and whats not.            In all, I believe that everybody should have the ability acquire whatever material they want from a library. It is an institution that is allows one to go places that they will never go and live lives they never will live. Its ability to do such should not be compromised.""","4"
"""In third grade, I took a book off the shelf of my local library that had an interesting cover. It was rather large, but I had come to love reading in that time of my life so I decided I was up for it. The genre of the book was fantasy which I enjoyed immensly. Although, there were some parts of the book that had me confused. There were scenes involving women that I did not understand, and many new words. Eventually, I came to ask my dad about a certain part of the book. He read the passage, and his eyes went wide. I never finished that book.     There is no doubt that I had a learning experience by reading that book, but, as my dad obviously thought, it @MONTH1 have been a little too much for that time in my life. If it were not for my mom not wanting to make a big deal out of it, my dad would have had a little chat with that library. Now that I am old enough to understand what was going on in that book, I realize that I lost some of my innocense because of it. There is simply some material that is not appropriate for children, and it should not be put in our public libraries. Not censoring what is put on the shelves seems obsurd considering my experience. If I have a son someday, I want to be the one telling him about the touchy subjects of women and swearing; it should not be from some fiction book. I also do not appreciate the other material found in our libraries. The music that I see has artists that write their songs without children in mind, movies have up to @NUM1 ratings, and magazines promote gossip and have sexual references.     Overall, it is disappointing to me that our libraries have allowed some of these things onto their shelves. As I think about my experience in third grade, I wish I had never seen that book. Maybe it would have allowed me to keep a little more innocense for a little bit longer, and maybe I would have respected women more through my youth. I would love to see more censorship in libraries so that we can protect today's children until the parents choose to open their eyes to the world.""","4"
"""Have you ever noticed how much bad materials are out there for childeren to get ahold of?  A movie, book, magazine, music, or even something on @CAPS1?  It would be nice to get rid of all that bad material, but what if someone else doesn't feel the same way about that song, movie, or @CAPS1 show?  I think it would be horrible if we took away all the bad materials because it might bring violence between some people who disagree on it, and it goes against one of our rights, freedom of speech.     In the world we live in today, if you take something away from someone like their favorite book, its going to bring out some violence between some people.  Look back into our history, we are a country full of rebels.  That is how @CAPS3 even came to be.  So take away something from people they are going to stand up and fight for it.  There will always be people trying to smuggle and hide some things, so we will never be able to get rid of it completly.

Don't try to take away all the offensive materials, it will just bring violence and make it all much worse than it was.  If you're a parent it's not like you can shield your children from everything because eventually they will learn what it all is.  So it won't do any good to try to get rid of it.

"""Do you believe libraries should remove items some people find offensive? Do you find some items offensive and want libraries to remove them? @CAPS2 is a major problem that many people don't think about often before acting. Here are some situations many people run into:     If one person finds a @CAPS1 offensive but no one else does, should @CAPS2 be removed? Many libraries contemplate whether or not they should remove an offensive item due to some peoples' opinions. This is because they know people like @CAPS2 and they know people don't; they wonder whether or not they should remove the item because a few people find @CAPS2 offensive, (this can range from books, music, movies, magazines, etc.). People often think they do what is best for everyone by asking the library staff to remove something they think is offensive. Honestly, they're only helping the people that want to have @CAPS2 removed and don't say anything, that is if the library removes the offensive item.     If the library removes the offensive item, they @MONTH1 lose a customer, if they don't remove the item they @MONTH1 lose a customer. So they are faced with a dillemma, 'remove the item or don't remove the item?' @CAPS2's a tough decision to make especially when they @MONTH1 lose more than a few customers based on either choice. So what do they do? They @MONTH1 poll the customers and see what they think, they @MONTH1 do nothing at all, or they @MONTH1 remove the item to keep the person happy. The problem is what happens if @CAPS2's a friend who liked the item and you don't want to hurt their feelings because the item has been there forever and they love @CAPS2 so much, but can't afford to buy @CAPS2 at a store. What do you do then? People often don't want to think of other people's' feelings and/or the decisions they would have to face over something as small as 'an offensive' item, and they say things that they wouldn't normally say just to get said item 'out of their sight.' @CAPS3 is they just don't want to agknowladge other people's' choices, feelingings, opinions, etc.     So what would you do if you found an offensive item at the library? Would you ask for @CAPS2 to be removed? Say nothing? @CAPS2 is your choice in the end, but not all people have the same tastes in books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that you do.

"""Censorship is the idea of blocking or removing things that are  offensive to peoples belief's, their religion, their race and just their ways of life. Therefore, i do not belive that books in libraries should be censored. I understand that things that people write can be offensive to yourself or others, but what if you found a book that was descriminating someone elses belief's but not yours. Would that still be okay with you to take those book off of the shelves?Also, taking books out of a library is not going to stop kids from learning about things that are not age approprite. If you do not want your child learning about them do not let them get it. You censor what your child reads and do not punish the people who go into the library and need the book.           There would be no more libraries if people really wanted to start taking books off the shelf for being offensive.

A prime example of this is the state funding schools which is a big issue we shouldn't just removed the school because someone doesn't like it.     In conclusion certain materials shouldn't be removed from shelves if they're found offensive for three reasons. The first reason being if you found something offensive it @MONTH1 not be to someone else. Next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things. The last reason being if we all just removed thing we dislike the world wouldn't be the way it is.""","4"
"""Dear Katherine Paterson,         Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed form the shelves if they are found offensive? I honestly don't think that's nessecary because not everybody @MONTH1 find those materials offensive. If a couple people think that a certain book or something is offensive then dont read it or pay attention to it, don't take something from someone that they like.     I think that if  there was people that found a certain topic interesting and there was also people who found it offensive, that they should keep the material and the people who dislike it would just have to get over it. Either way I think that they shouldn't remove those materials, enless everyone agrees that it's offensive.That's not fair to everyone else who likes that topic, just because one person found it offensive. Now if a magazine for the public is being racist or something like that then maybe that can be considered being removed, but other than that I see no reason why you should take away something that some people @MONTH1 enjoy. Let's say I enjoy movies, books, or magazines about hunting and people find it offensive to kill animals for the fun of it or for food. Just because that single person doesn't like that certain thing doesn't mean they should take it away from everyone else. That's just there opinion on things and you can't always get what you want, so just deal with it.      Well those are my thoughts on rather or not you should remove materials that some people find offensive. My last opinion is if you don't like the material and it offends you don't read it or have anything to do with it. Other than that you shouldn't take materials away from people enless everyone agrees on it.                                                   Sincerly,                                                          @PERSON2""","3"
"""Many @CAPS1 have different opinions about what's appropriate and what's not. It's depends on one's beliefs and morals. I personally don't think that there should be any censorship in libraries.     I think that @CAPS1 should have the freedom to choose what to read, watch, or listen to. Each person should be able to make a decision depending on what they believe. It also depends on a person's age and maturity level. Some parents let their kids watch certain movies that maybe other parents wouldn't. The situation is different for each person.     It's hard to judge certain materials because some @CAPS1 might find it acceptable while others might not. There would be contraversy over virtually everything because everybody has different standards of what's acceptable what's not, and these standards would clash with each other. It would be impossible to make sure that nothing in libraries would be offensive to @CAPS1. If someone finds something offensive, then they don't have to check it out.     I also think that there are some things that can be done to help appease the argument. For example materials can be catorgorized by maturity level. That's what movie ratings are for. Materials should be organized that @CAPS1 can easily see if they would be offensive or not. For example all the kids movies and books can be put together so that way parents don't have to worry about their kids seeing or reading something that would be inappropriate. It should be obvious to @CAPS1 who would find it offensive and who wouldn't      @CAPS1 should have the individual freedom to make decisions for themselves. A library is a public place for anybody to go check out anything they want. Just because somebody finds a book offensive, that doesn't mean that nobody should be allowed to read it. That being said, certain things can be done so that @CAPS1 would know if something would be offensive or not.""","3"
"""How would you feel if you wrote a story about your life, and someone found it offensive, so the took the book off of the shelves? I feel as if the censorship in libraries is becoming a controversial problem for the following reasons: it is wrong to take away freedoms, people have different opinions and views, and some books, magazines, or songs are trying to make people aware of dangers.     One important aspect in why censorship is becoming controversial is; it takes away our freedom of speech. In @LOCATION1, we have the right to speak our minds. If everything we read was censored, there would be nothing to read. The liberties and freedoms of @CAPS1 citizens should not be taken away because of something that is thought to be inappropriate.     Another reason why I believe censorship is wrong is; different people have completely different opinions on things. One person might feel that a book about a sexual assault victim is offensive, while another person might think the book is informational and helpful. No one can base censorship on one belief or idea, because it will never be the belief or idea that everyone approves of.      A third reason why censorship should not be inforced as much is; it takes away the awarness of the dangers in everyday life. Stories about people who were kidnapped, or were in a car crash because the person who was driving was under the influence of drugs, can be a good thing. Eventhough the story @MONTH1 have some accounts that are not appropriate, it could be very influencial, and convince someone to make the right choice. If we censor stories about abduction, drugs, alcohol, or people making the wrong choices, no one will be able to read a story about it and make the right choice instead of making the same mistake as the person.        Although stories or magazine articles that @MONTH1 be seen as vulgar are looked down upon, they help to make people aware, give people the freedom of speech, and allow them to have their own opinions. Censorship in libraries and media should be abolished""","4"
"""I actually do believe that they should be able to be removed from the shelf. On the other hand i do not believe that anything rascist should be on library shelfs. Teens these days want to be able to pick up a book that they can actually relate to and the same thing goes for a movie, nusic, and a magazine.      You can't help what people want to listen to or like to read or watch. I don't really like robot movie's or any of that crap so that wouldn't be something i'd pick out to watch. On the other hand i don't think that it should have to be removed out of the library just because i dont like it. Also something like @CAPS1 in the @LOCATION1, i don't think that it should be removed from shelve's just because of the title. Family @CAPS2 is a really funny show but also has a lot of bad language in it but i don't think it should be removed because thats what people like to watch. Teens want to be able to read about they can relate to, but some of the things in the book can be offensive maybe. If they didn't have anything to read that they could relate to hardly anyone would read. Not everyone listens to the same music but a @NUM1 yr old doesn't want to go around listening to barney, they want to listen to the music that they like and think is cool, but on the other hand others @MONTH1 not like it. Not letting you get something off of the library shelf because it's bad is like saying you can't eat a certain kind of food because its bad for you.     If people didn't get to listen to, read, or watch the things that they like they would be screwed and very upset. I think people are entitled to their own opinion, although some people's opinions could be rather stupid. Not everyone likes the same things and we shouldn't have to.""","3"
"""From my own observations I do not beleive that any materials should be removed from libraries.  All students have the right to read/learn about different subjects.  Even if that includes some of them being offensive.     Some subjects might be considerderd offensive, like the holocaust for example.  If we didnt learn about what happened during that horrific time it could possibly happen again without us even knowing that it has happened before.  But it is the students choice to read about that subject or to simply ignore it if it is cosidered offensive.     In conclusion I do not beleive that materials in libraries should be censored or removed from shelves.  People need to learn a little about everything that goes on in this world to be a better, more educated, well-rounded individual.""","3"

"""How would you feel if you were at your local library and you found something with something offensive in it? Many people would not approve of having offensive materials in their library. The library is open to anyone and anyone could see the material. Library's should make sure there isn't anything offinsive in their materials before they put them on the shelf.         Everyone has access to the library in your district and can look at anything that is there. A lot of stuff that can be found in your library could be offensive; but how would people know what is offensive and what isn't? Library's shouldn't have that accessable. If they still have it in your library, then it should have a warning on it or be on a high shelf. Library's should be aware of what they are putting on the shelves and know if it is appropriate or not.         Furthermore, children also have access to the public library. Most of the time the child will have an adult with them but sometimes they can pick up something before you can stop them. If there is something offensive in a child's reach, they might grab it and see whats in it. Most librarys have a childrens section where you can trust that there isn't anything offensive in it. Not all children will just go to the childrens section so there shouldn't be offensive material in library's or at least in childrens reach.         Lastly, librarys choose what they put on the shelves and they never know who will look at it. If there is offensive material in their stuff then anyone can see it and it could put a negative thought in some peoples heads. There are some people who are mature enough to see the offensive material but there are others who can't. Thoes that can't, it @MONTH1 reflect something negative on them and it @MONTH1 cause problems. Therefore, there should not be offinsive material in librarys.     In @CAPS1, librarys should not supply offinsive material. If there are people that want to see that kind of stuff there are other ways of getting that material. There shouldn't be access to that in your library because everyone can see it and you don't know how it will effect them. If there is going to be offinsive material in your library there should be an adult area where only people over the age of @NUM1 can enter. If there is something offinsive that is open to anyone, hopefully one day librarys will elimanate them.""","4"
"""I believe that if there are offensive books,music,movies,and magazines are in the libraries. I think they should be taking off the shelf , @CAPS1 people should not want there children's reading or looking at thing they should not be looking at. Today I'm going againt the views on the censorship in the libraries.      I think we should fight for what the libraries should have in the build for our children to read. The materials that the libraries has that are offensive should be put up in another area for older poeple. Not for the children's that go to the libraries. I'm asking the newspaper to help us to fight for what the libraries should have on there shelf for our young people and are children's.      And  what type's of book should be in the children part in the libraries on the shelf. We should have right's to take off book's on  the children side. And have rights to put offensive materials on the side for older people that like books,music,movies,and magazines but not for young children to read. The point I'm trying to make is that we should think about what our children's should be learn.     And what they should know as a young person. They should not grow up to fast like some people are .We need to make the better for our young children's. So they can do the same for there self and for there children's some day.""","2"
"""If you walk into a store and see a book you dont like or a magazine you could care less for, should you be able to get rid of it? My answer to that is no you should not. You do not own the libraries books and you do not have any say on what is displayed in any store. You are the viewers and buyers to these suppliers and if you dont like it dont buy it or look.     When I was in the eighth grade I went to @LOCATION2 for a church missions trip. There was alot of cool things there that I saw. This was one of the most popular places in the @LOCATION1. When we wouldn't be working or serving others we would walk around and do some shopping. There is alot of people in this city and it was packed all the time. Now with that being said there was alot of different stores and there are some in my opinion at the time that i thought were very inappropiate for my age level. My whole group walked into a store where we just really didnt belong and we all had no clue this was the kind of store this was. Our actions simply invovled nodding our heads good bye at the cashier and walking out continuing our day of shopping. We did not remove any books, pictures, or even magazines in that store. Reason being is that, that was their store and we had no right to remove anything. After we left there other people walked in that store and liked what they saw if we would have removed those items they wouldnt of got to see what they liked. That would be like someone removing something from a store I like meaning i'd never get to see it and I wouldn't want that.     If you walk in to a store and see something you do not like you shouldn't be able to try and get rid of that object. Whether you want your kids seeing it or not you just cant do it. You take your own risk walking into a store and seeing what they have in store for you.You are there to browse around or buy a few things if you would like too. Every store should have their own certain things and what you find offensive other people might like. That goes for the opposite too what other people find offensive you might like. It is all a big chain with many loops.      So say you do take that piece of material off that shelf or off the display. Now that material is gone all because of you thought it was offensive. Say another person walks in the ame store and takes something off the shelve that they thought was offensive. Now there is two things gone from the shelve, but you actually liked what they took off the shelve and your upset that they took that off. This will cause alot of conflict and big situations in the future if this was allowed. One person likes it one person doesnt. If you dont like what you see in a store then you shouldn't walk in or you should simply ignore the stuff that is offensive to you.     These are some of my opinions about this catagory. I believe you shouldn't be able to take stuff off shelves and terminate other stores products. Always be aware of what your getting your self into and know the outcome of the decisions you make. This could cause alot of lossed jobs and many conflicts between shoppers and viewers like you. I hope you take this into consideration and understand my reasonings for what I have said""","4"
"""Libraries are very educational. They provide books, movies, magazines, music, and computers for you to locate something you are looking for. I dont think that libraries include anything offensive. If anyone finds anything that a library has that is offensive to them, then they should talk to someone who works there and see if they can come to a solution. It shouldnt be removed because not everyone @MONTH1 find it offensive.          I've been to many libraries in my life and personally, it's amazing all the books, and things for you do there. I've actually gained alot of knowledge at the libraries i've been to because i found so many books that were just amazing. Never, have i ran into something that was offensive to me or anyone else. Everyone is different though, we have all have a different view on things and we all are unique. If a library does have something that's offensive to everyone then maybe it should be removed but like i said earlier if it's not offensive to everyone then it shouldnt be removed.           I personally, think libraries hold so many unique things that if somethings were offensive to people then i'd understand why everyone would want it to be removed. If someone came up to me and said 'hey, i find this music to be very inappropriate for young children to listen to' i would say, 'well, that @MONTH1 be true, but some children do listen to that music, it wouldnt be fair to remove it, just because one person doesn't like it.

"""Definately not, they @MONTH1 be offensive to some but not all. Everybody will be projected to offensive material sometime in their life, so their is no real reason to censor materials. These materials are made to entertain someone, some are entertained by offensive material. I honestly dont think that anything in the library is so offensive that it needs to be took out.      If any material offends you, you dont have to acknowledge it, you can always check out different material. If censor material then you are going against the first amendment, @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. Everyone will find something offensive about a certain material and demand it gets taken off the shelf or censored, what happens when every book has been marked as offensive? We have no books, thats what.          Books are made by the author writing down his idea's and creating a plot, some will think his idea's are offensive but not all will. Whether people think its offensive or not people still enjoy those books. Anyone can create material and share their idea's, those idea's could still be offensive but it doesnt matter, because we have @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 to say whatever we want and to not be prosecuted by it. If you ban any type of material, your prosecuting the voice of the creator's opinions, then all your doing is denying the @NUM1 amendment & being a hypocrite.      Censorship of music and movies is not right either. When you censor movies and music your also censoring out their idea's. Music is an expression of life and censoring that would be like censoring emotion. Censorship of the movies, music, & books is just prohibiting the expansion of culture.

"""Have you been to a library and saw no books or magazines on the shelfs? Well if the libraries try taking away all the books and magazines that are offensive then there wouldn't be anything there to read. If you pick up a book or magazine and you think it offends you then don't read it, grab a knew one. through out this article you will hear about how movies can be offensive, and how libraires shouldn't empty their shelves over it, then my belief against this topic.     Movies, books, magazines and music can be offensive. If you think about it though if you get offended then don't read or listen or watch it. You just simply have to grab a new book. Now the question comes, what if its the best book or movie up there? If thats the case then watch it but just know its your own choice to. If you really want to get those books, movies, etc., off those shelves then grab one that just really offends you and take it to the manager and ask him/her to read it or you read a part to them. If he/she don't she a problem with it tell him/her to read from your perspective and then think about it. After you get done with that ask him/her wants a stack of the books, etc., that offend you. Thats when you start piling up the stacks right in front of him/her.     The libraries on the other hand if your getting bombarded with people coming in and sayin this books offends me I can't belive this on your shelves, what if a little kid got ahold of this.......!  Managers or owners if you get people coming in to tell you to read this book, watch this movie. What do you do? In my opinion i'd read or watch maybe the first two or three but after that i'd start playin it off and just agreeing to get them out of your office. Now you gotta think, man if all these people keep coming in here and saying these books, movies, etc. are offensive then you really got to take action. If you take books away from the libraries then you loose sales. I've been to a lbrary where everything was catagorized so people know what there looking through before they start reading which is what I think all libraries should do instead of just putting them out on the shelves.     My belief on the topic is that you go into a lbrary knowing whats in a lbrary, books! Now if you go in there and theres a book or movie that alot of people complained about then i'd see them making an effort to get rid of it. But if your the only one then i highly doubt they will make a special effort to get rid of it. You also got to think the author of the book didn't write it just to offend you, their not singling you out.If its that bad where you can't read or watch it without something setting you off then take it back ang grab a new one. If that book or movie is their best seller they're not going to destroy it because of one single person. So if you go to a library and check out a book or movie without knowing whats it about then I wouldn't blame them for not doing anything about it, its your choice not theirs.     This article took alot of diffrent sides which is good in a way because its not just about one single topic. However if you keep nagging on the manager to get that book or movie out of there and they still don't do it then go to a different library. Maybe that library wont have as many books, movies, magazines, etc., to get offended about and if there is maybe they will be cool about the situation and try fixing the problem to benefit the two of you. So if you read this article and get offended by it then sorry, just expressing personal opinion and trying to get you to solve your problems. thanks for reading""","4"
"""What are we hiding from? Is personal expression really that bad? Questions such as these come to mind when the topic of censorship in libraries arises. In my own personal opinion I believe forbidding works of art from libraries is the same as destroying the people @CAPS1 created them. Censorship in general is a way to hide reality and sugar coat the struggles within life itself. One can not learn unless given the oppurtunity to face the problems in society and the world. By banning certain pieces, the world destroys an opportunity to expand the knowledge of every individual.      With the removal of materials such as books and music, libraries ruin the time spent and heart that the creators have placed trustfully within them. Although most people use these materials strictly for entertainment, the writers and musicians created them for self expression and to show their pain and struggles. It could even be said that expression such as this is theraputic for these specific individuals. How would you react if your form of art was dibbed unsuitable for a public audience? Would you be hurt and taken back? Many artists probably feel that they are being placed in a state of seclusion and hatred. With the creation of art there is always a deeper meaning behind them. The biggest question in my eyes is, ' @CAPS1 deems that material as unsuitable for libraries'? What can be so wrong with specific material that we must take it away from everyone? At the pace our world is going today their will be no individualism left within the next fifty years. If people are not even allowed to listen to specific types of music, sooner or later people won't be able to wear certain types of clothes or even dye their hair a different color. The human population's greatest gift is their ability to be different. If our society cannot even handle freedom of expression through art, how can it handle any other type?     Libraries are created as a place to expand knowledge. If materials are censored how can anyone learn? Every individual has their own way of thinking and interpreting subjects. A book seen as entertainment and down-time reading to one person @MONTH1 be the very thing that strikes a world changing idea in the mind of another. A human's greatest idea comes strictly from the knowledge they have accumulated throughout their life time and off of their interests. If certain forms of art are censored individuals will never be able to find that form of interest in certain subjects. Everyone will strictly be forced to believe and learn the same things, restricting the world from the magical ideas one man could have formed with the information obtained from the art that had been censored. In a discussion based class I previously took, we read an article discussing the @ORGANIZATION1's decision to ban any information related to the loss of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and the terrible things their society had done in their attempt of complete succesion from the @LOCATION1. Through ideas such as this, you are not only taking knowledge, but also implanting lies into the heads of the next generation. In that specific situation in the @ORGANIZATION1 it created a hatred and false sense of the @CAPS4 in the childrens' eyes. How can one specifically influence the beliefs of a child @CAPS1 is only @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old based off of their personal selfish beliefs? Through censorship we are destroying the truth and knowledge that each individual deserves if they are determined to find it.      The biggest thing about censorship is the cover up of reality. Do libraries think if they do not publically display a controlversial topic no one will know about it? Knowledge is all around us. No one needs a book to tell you our world is not perfect. For all we know, a book censored could have saved millions of lives. I cannot fully grasp the concept in my head of hiding materials from the public. There will soon come a time where expression at all will be censored. If we are getting rid of art should we remove people too? I can relate censoring books to censoring people based on my own personal experience. A teacher once told me that I would not ever achieve my career, because I had piercings. Opinions such as these could kill a person's dreams. I have known that I wanted to be a lawyer since I was seven years old and have been working to better my education based on my goals. How can you tell someone that they are not good enough based on your specific beliefs? There will always be something in the world you do not like. Each library @MONTH1 decided to censor a different type of art from their individual location. Eventually the world will have no art left, because those few people chose that it was not suitable for everyone. I can almost guarentee that most individuals have lived through worse experiences than what are being covered up. The world cannot be sugar coated or portrayed as perfect, because that is not lfe. Everyone will struggle at some point and its works of art that really get us through it. Sometimes we relate to them or in my case art such as music is what makes me feel better when I am hurt. The pain will always be there. Going through reality and the struggles is what makes each individual @CAPS1 they are. Censorship in libraries will not hide anything from the public, it will just destroy an oppurtunity to grow.     Censorship in libraries is what will destroy our world. No individual can say that material is not suited for the public, because they are not the public. Every person poses their own opinions on life. By banning these works of art you are banning individuality as a whole. If things like this continue our planet will become mindless zombies will no personal opinions. Libraries will be taking knowledge from everyone and ruin the chances for greatness for many people. There is no true way to hide reality from the world. Let people display their feelings through their art and share it with the world. The struggles of one person @MONTH1 be what saves another and allows the ideals of the world as a whole to grow""","4"
"""Several years ago a parent at my school complained to the administration about a book, The @PERSON2, her child was about to read for his english class. She believed that it was an inappropriate book for a ninth grader to read. She was in her rights to be a little nervous about the book, there had been concerns from within the school when it had been added to the ciriculum. The administration eventually decided to keep the book as part of the class because even though the approprietness of one scene @MONTH1 have been in question the rest of the book taught lessons taht were important to children, like tolerance for other cultures, the imaortance of right and wrong and that you must fix the things that you have done wrong.     Although I understand that parents do not want to expose their precious children to the rest of the world, I believe that it is important to be exposed to a wide variety of materials because it helps people learn about different cultures and other ways of life. I once read a quote that said something a long the lines of understatnding leads to tolerance. We cannot ban books and other media because we think they are inapproriate for a situation. Being able to understand another person's culture or point of view @MONTH1 one day lead to the solution of problems in out world today, such as the crisis in the @LOCATION1 involving the @CAPS1 and the @CAPS2.     I agree very much with the quote by Katherine Paterson about how if we all take away books and other media that we dislike we would have nothing left. A good example of this is the popular internet video site, @CAPS3. There are thousands of videos listed on this site and millions of people who watch them. On each video there is a place to leave feedback on whether you liked or dislike said video. With all of the different viewpoints, opinions, and interests of the millions of people who have viewed this site it is very difficult to find a video without at least one or two dislikes. If we all had the power to take videos we disliked off the site, there would be none left for us to watch.     Another reason why we cannot just remove offensive things from our shelves is that without authors taking a little rebellious flair and exposing new ideas, the material we read would quickly becme very boring. During the women's suffrage movment, the men of this country thought the idea of women being allowed to vote was offensive. Now after many years it is seen as a commonplace thing and it is now a legal right for women to vote.This is an example of how a once radical idea has now gained support and made people's lives better. If we take these books from our shelves we are harming ourselves and allowing us to become ignorant.     All books and media have value, whether they express just one person's ideas or the thoughts of thousands. We remove material from our shelves at a risk to ourselves as individuals and as a society as a whole. I believe that the founding fathers of our country knew what they were doing when they included the freeedom of speech in the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6. If we remove books and other media from the literal and figurative shelves of our society, are we not denying the authors, writers, singers, and publishers who made those works their freedom of speech?""","4"
"""The old saying one should never judge a book by it's cover comes into litteral meaning with this particular subject. Every mind that is among the world is extremely different, just as every book is. One person @MONTH1 look upon a certain subject as offensive, while others @MONTH1 not have the same point of view. However, in my personal opinion books with 'suggestive' references or language should be placed in sections marked mature and clearly labeled with a warning of the contents lieing between the pages. With over a billion different points of views residing all over the world, why should books that only a few select find inappropriate people be removed?     Every person has their own life story and rough experiences. Life's journey brings bumps in the road which can scare someone deeply and change their life forever. While reading a book, a viewer @MONTH1 skim across a passage that brings horrible experiences swelling back up in them. For one to have to relive a trauma that they have struggled to get over isn't right, but for another to read about a situation similar to a particular person's life journey could possibly grant them more understanding and compassion for the victim. I do not believe victims of abuse no matter what degree should have to read about that subject in a book they thought they were reading for leisure. However, these books should not be taken off the shelves because people who have not had to endure a struggle such as this should be able to grasp a better understanding for the other person.      Books for a more mature mind should be monitored and placed upon a shelf out of reach from a child who can not yet handle that topic. At a young age I selected a book I had thought was a ghost story. Mid way through I came to the understanding that the book was truly about a young girl my age being raped. As a sixth grader I was horrified because I was not yet exposed to that danger of the world, and I was not mature enough to handle that subject. For weeks I walked the halls scaared that I might have the same fate as the girl in the story I had read. Books with mature topics should be seperated from those for younger childeren, because the description in a book @MONTH1 leave a child with emotional scares.     Labeling books clearly with any 'suggestive' content the book @MONTH1 contain would help this issue tremendously. If books are clearly labeled that they contain offensive words, comments, or horrifying situations, then a reader who will become offended will have less likely of a chance to grab the material. If children who are still developing their level of maturity come across a book that mentions inappropriate subjects, they will have a better understanding of what they @MONTH1 be about to view. By simply pressing a label on a book that states the concerns can be found within the pages, it will save the world alot of harm.     If books begin to fly off the shelves because of offensive topics, their won't be many books left to read. Every person takes a different look at what a story says, just as every age group comprehends the message that passages give differently. By monitoring and labeling books, book worms will be able make a quick decision on whether or not the material they think they want to read is for them. So, in conclusion don't take away the wanders of reading from those who enjoy traveling through the imagination of books, but let them know exactly what they will see as they mosey through the unknown pages of a new adventure.""","4"
"""Yes, I believe that libraries should remove certain materials from the book shelves if they are found offensive to someone. First of all a oerson doesn't go to the library to get offended. Also if the liberian should know whats appropiate for the library. And items like the ones who offend people should not even be in a public area.     A person does't go to the library to see something that offends them. People go to the library to read, study and to have a quiet time. And the people that go to use the library for a resourse, should not find themselves in a situation were they feel that they are being offended by a book, movie or magazine, because of what the autor says in the writeing. People might get offended and stop going to the library.     Also the liberian is incharged of the items he wants to display in his library. If the liberian feel that a book its okay to be displayed he can dispay it, but if the book is offensive to someone else, he should be asked to remove the book. And if the book is resourceful for study the liberian should keep it in an area were people that want the book can ask for it.     Stuff like that should not even be published in a public area. I think that there should be a law that does not allow offencive literature, music, movies etc... In libraries. Now this days people are allowed to donate items of litereature or intertainment to libraries, but i think that people should make sure that the items they are donateing are okay to be displayed.     So yes I believe that offensive materials shoud be removed from the libraries. Because libraries are places were you go to have a quiet time to read and not to get offended. The librarian should be incharged of what he or she wants to dislay. Aand last stuff like that should not even be in a public area""","3"
"""It seems you cannot always make everyone happy. No matter what, someone is offended or upset over something. This holds true with everything- including media. Whether it be a book, movie, or a song, someone somewhere will be unhappy with it for some reason. Though this is true, it certainly does not mean you can take that media away from those who enjoy it. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 @LOCATION1 that all people are granted freedom of speech and freedom of press. Would taking 'offensive' material off of shelves not take away from this right so clearly and intently given to us? Not only that, but does sheltering the public and making us all believe the world is a place without bias, prejudice, or slander really help us in the grand scheme of things? Pretending that the world is perfect ensures that future generations of the world will be devestated by reality once they get out in the real world and realize everything is not perfect and nice and unbiased all the time.     My ninth grade year in high school, I read 'To @CAPS4 A @CAPS5' by @PERSON1. This book demonstrates the harsh prejudice that used to be normal in the @LOCATION4 during the earlier years of the @LOCATION1. This book could certainly be considered offensive by a person living in the southern @LOCATION1; one could say this book steriotypes people in the @LOCATION4. One could also say this book is offensive because of the language it uses. African-@CAPS6 could be offended by the explicit rascist comments and names within the pages. Despite this, 'To @CAPS4 A @CAPS5' is considered a classic and is praised and tought throughout the @LOCATION1 and the rest of the world. I grew from reading @PERSON1's masterpiece- it tought me a lot about where the @LOCATION1 has been and how far it has come with acceptance of other races. You learn from your mistakes, they say. Therefore, we can learn from the media's mistakes. We can grow as people from being offended or having offensive material brought to our attention. We can stop history from repeating itsself by being well-informed.     Theology is a huge matter of dispute among all cultures; @CAPS9 or @CAPS10'ite, @LOCATION2, @CAPS11, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION5, @CAPS12. Any book store you walk into, you can find a bible or a book on atheism or even '@ORGANIZATION1,' which focuses on @CAPS13. Any music store you walk into, you can find bands that bash the ideas of religion, but you can also find theistic worship bands or meditating music. Just the same, any movie theater or movie store you visit could supply movies with anti-theistic or pro-theistic themes.Taking such things off of the shelves because one work could be offensive to a group of people could limit another's options to explore theology and find out what suits them. It could limit one's exploration of interests. It could very well take away from one's personal growth.     In any case, it is unfair to take something that could be considered offensive to one person away from another just for the sake of being nice and having discretion. Putting a ban on certain works could harm the flow of society. Putting a ban on certain works could limit one's awareness of the world around them or the history they could potentially be inspired by, it could limit the expansion of one's intellect, it could take away from one's exploration of interests or the search of who they really are or want to be. It is best to just keep things the way they are- free.""","5"
